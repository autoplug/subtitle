1
00:04:13,464 --> 00:04:17,503
ï always worry that maybe people aren't
gonna like me when I go to a party.

2
00:04:17,664 --> 00:04:19,859
Isn't that crazy?

3
00:04:20,704 --> 00:04:26,142
Do you ever get kind of a sick feeling in
your stomach when you dread things?

4
00:04:26,304 --> 00:04:29,501
I wouldn't wanna miss a party,
but every time I go to one. . .

5
00:04:29,664 --> 00:04:33,339
. . .I keep feeling like
the whole world's against me.

6
00:04:33,504 --> 00:04:36,701
See, I've spent my whole life
in military academies.

7
00:04:36,864 --> 00:04:39,697
My mother doesn't have a place for me
where she lives. . .

8
00:04:39,864 --> 00:04:42,298
. . .and she doesn't know
what else to do with me.

9
00:04:42,464 --> 00:04:47,015
You mustn't misunderstand about
my mother. She's really a lovely person.

10
00:04:47,184 --> 00:04:51,575
I guess every boy thinks his mother
is beautiful, but my mother really is.

11
00:04:51,744 --> 00:04:56,181
She tells me in every letter how sorry
she is that we're not together more. . .

12
00:04:56,344 --> 00:04:59,416
. . .but she has to think of her work.

13
00:04:59,584 --> 00:05:03,372
One time we were together, though.
She met me in San Francisco once. . .

14
00:05:03,544 --> 00:05:08,220
. . .and we were together for two whole
days, just like we were sweethearts.

15
00:05:08,384 --> 00:05:12,059
It was the most wonderful time
I ever had.

16
00:05:12,224 --> 00:05:16,536
Then I had to go back
to the military academy.

17
00:05:16,704 --> 00:05:20,856
Every time I walk into that barracks,
I get a kind of. . . .

18
00:05:26,704 --> 00:05:28,854
A kind of a. . . .

19
00:05:33,304 --> 00:05:35,101
I'm sorry.

20
00:05:41,944 --> 00:05:44,697
Kind of a depressed feeling.

21
00:05:44,864 --> 00:05:48,618
It's got hard, stone walls.
You know what I mean?

22
00:05:49,184 --> 00:05:52,699
I guess I've bored you enough,
telling you about myself.

23
00:05:54,144 --> 00:05:55,736
Thank you.

24
00:05:55,904 --> 00:06:00,056
Sorry about that. I goofed up the last
couple of lines. I guess I'm nervous.

25
00:06:00,344 --> 00:06:02,141
That's okay. You did very well.

26
00:06:14,264 --> 00:06:16,016
I'm sorry.

27
00:06:40,064 --> 00:06:42,703
Thank you. You play very well.

28
00:06:42,864 --> 00:06:47,858
Now Mrs. Tossoff's gonna play notes
for you. Sing them back to us. Like so:

29
00:06:51,784 --> 00:06:56,062
-It's too low for me.
-You're a tenor? You want to start here?

30
00:06:58,624 --> 00:07:00,854
Louder, please.

31
00:07:37,344 --> 00:07:39,175
I'm so nervous.

32
00:07:39,344 --> 00:07:41,619
-I'm not singing.
-But you have to.

33
00:07:41,784 --> 00:07:43,979
-But I came to dance.
-You have to sing too.

34
00:07:44,144 --> 00:07:46,453
-And act, and play an instrument.
-All three?

35
00:07:46,624 --> 00:07:49,582
-It says "performing arts," doesn't it?
-You don't have to do everything.

36
00:07:49,784 --> 00:07:55,416
-Sure as shit helps, baby.
-Thank you. Next group, please. Hurry.

37
00:07:55,584 --> 00:07:58,542
-Oh, I like your nose ring.
-I'm into culture.

38
00:07:58,744 --> 00:08:02,703
-Does that hurt, or is that ethnic?
-Music, please, Mrs. Snell.

39
00:08:02,864 --> 00:08:06,493
Please pay attention.
We have a lot to do today.

40
00:08:09,384 --> 00:08:12,217
-I hate my legs.
-Yeah. Me too.

41
00:08:12,424 --> 00:08:16,212
-I've tried every diet in the whole world.
-Really? Me too.

42
00:08:16,584 --> 00:08:21,021
But you can't help your glands.
I'm sorry! I'm just so nervous.

43
00:08:21,184 --> 00:08:24,142
Relax! Come on, use your body.

44
00:08:33,384 --> 00:08:36,979
-Careful. That's 7000 worth of machine.
-Dollars or pounds?

45
00:08:37,144 --> 00:08:40,534
Don't touch the rotary pods.
I got it set on saw-tooth.

46
00:08:40,704 --> 00:08:45,141
Why can't he play piccolo? Something
sensible. Or the accordion, like Papa did.

47
00:08:45,304 --> 00:08:48,853
Same reason you drive a checker and
not a Roman chariot. It's progress.

48
00:08:49,024 --> 00:08:52,937
My son's head is into the future.
And Papa could never play the accordion.

49
00:08:57,984 --> 00:09:01,454
-Do you think you're talented?
-You swine! You coward! You cad!

50
00:09:01,664 --> 00:09:04,053
You dare judge me in my misfortitude?

51
00:09:04,224 --> 00:09:07,853
You dare to ask me the question
who is the father of my child?

52
00:09:08,024 --> 00:09:12,495
-You! You! I point to you, Nigel!
-Next, please.

53
00:09:12,744 --> 00:09:17,977
The next group of musicians can
go to the fifth floor now, please.

54
00:09:30,664 --> 00:09:32,416
-Name?
-Excuse me, miss.

55
00:09:32,584 --> 00:09:36,213
You don't need his name. He's not here
for the audition. He's my partner.

56
00:09:36,384 --> 00:09:38,454
-What school's he from?
-He ain't into school.

57
00:09:38,624 --> 00:09:43,493
He's just helping me out with my
dancing. But it's me who's auditioning.

58
00:09:43,664 --> 00:09:47,498
Mulholland, Shirley. I'm all fixed up.
I filled in all your papers and all.

59
00:09:47,664 --> 00:09:49,814
He doesn't go upstairs
without filling in his name.

60
00:09:49,984 --> 00:09:54,933
Leroy's his name, but I'm auditioning.
Shirley Mulholland. That's two L's.

61
00:09:55,104 --> 00:09:59,495
-And don't ask him to do no writing.
-Doesn't he talk, even?

62
00:09:59,704 --> 00:10:02,264
He ain't into conversation
until you get to know him.

63
00:10:02,784 --> 00:10:06,663
-Leroy what?
-Leroy Johnson. Can we go up now?

64
00:10:07,184 --> 00:10:09,857
He's not going up
until he checks his knife.

65
00:10:10,024 --> 00:10:13,141
We ain't staying long enough for
no trouble. He's just helping a friend.

66
00:10:13,344 --> 00:10:16,541
He's not helping out anyone
unless he checks his knife.

67
00:10:16,704 --> 00:10:20,219
This is the High School for Performing
Arts. We don't cut each other up here.

68
00:10:21,224 --> 00:10:22,942
-You want it?
-I want it.

69
00:10:23,264 --> 00:10:25,573
-You sure you want it?
-Yeah, I'm sure.

70
00:10:26,784 --> 00:10:29,742
-Promise you won't steal it, now?
-I promise.

71
00:10:32,104 --> 00:10:34,413
-Thanks, ma'am.
-Name?

72
00:10:34,624 --> 00:10:37,900
Don't worry, baby. I got lots of knives.

73
00:10:38,744 --> 00:10:41,656
-What are you going to do for us?
-I was gonna sing.

74
00:10:41,864 --> 00:10:45,095
-You don't have to sing, honey.
-We know our rights.

75
00:10:45,264 --> 00:10:49,303
-You can't refuse her an audition.
-She's not supposed to sing her audition.

76
00:10:49,464 --> 00:10:54,299
Please, excuse me, if you don't mind.
Honey, you don't have to sing for us. . .

77
00:10:54,464 --> 00:10:58,093
-. . .because this is the drama department.
-When she sings, it is drama.

78
00:10:58,384 --> 00:11:00,852
-What's your name, honey?
-Finsecker.

79
00:11:03,264 --> 00:11:04,538
Doris Finsecker.

80
00:11:10,304 --> 00:11:13,216
-Hi.
-How do you do?

81
00:11:13,384 --> 00:11:15,420
-What's your name?
-Ralph Garci.

82
00:11:15,744 --> 00:11:19,737
-Who was your teacher?
-Well, my father taught me.

83
00:11:19,904 --> 00:11:24,500
He's doing work for the government.
I'm not supposed to talk about it. . .

84
00:11:24,704 --> 00:11:30,700
. . .but my father played some of the
most beautiful symphonies. . .

85
00:11:30,864 --> 00:11:33,458
-. . .in the whole world once.
-What did he play?

86
00:11:34,624 --> 00:11:36,501
Trombones.

87
00:11:37,464 --> 00:11:39,739
And French horns.

88
00:11:41,224 --> 00:11:42,213
English horns.

89
00:11:44,224 --> 00:11:46,215
-Saxophones.
-Anything else?

90
00:11:46,424 --> 00:11:47,698
Yeah.

91
00:11:49,064 --> 00:11:53,899
-Bongos, maracas, that sort of stuff.
-What did he teach you?

92
00:12:01,824 --> 00:12:03,735
Why don't you
try the dance department.

93
00:12:03,904 --> 00:12:07,260
-Why do you want to go to school here?
-Should I tell him?

94
00:12:07,664 --> 00:12:08,813
Yeah, tell him.

95
00:12:09,584 --> 00:12:12,496
We can't afford a professional
children's school.

96
00:12:14,384 --> 00:12:18,377
Okay. If you want to sing, go ahead.
Then we'll look at your acting.

97
00:12:19,544 --> 00:12:21,182
I'm a little nervous.

98
00:12:21,384 --> 00:12:25,980
Don't be shy, Sheila. Come over here.
What are you going to do?

99
00:12:26,224 --> 00:12:29,102
-I'm doing The Towering lnferno.
-What?

100
00:12:30,304 --> 00:12:33,341
-You know, the movie?
-Oh.

101
00:12:33,784 --> 00:12:36,821
All right, I'm playing O.J. Simpson.
I'm in this building.

102
00:12:36,984 --> 00:12:40,454
There's fire all around, right?
So I go to the elevator.

103
00:12:40,664 --> 00:12:44,498
Think of it as a concentration exercise.
Just sing to Michael. . .

104
00:12:44,704 --> 00:12:49,937
-. . .and don't worry about anybody else.
-I don't think I can. I can't just stare.

105
00:12:50,144 --> 00:12:51,702
He won't mind.

106
00:12:54,984 --> 00:12:59,102
-Waiting for the elevator.
-Press the button, Doris.

107
00:13:03,904 --> 00:13:05,098
Her brother Harvey.

108
00:13:25,824 --> 00:13:28,657
Doesn't come, so now I'm getting mad.

109
00:14:07,384 --> 00:14:11,696
Finally it comes, so I get in.
Okay, and there's people all around.

110
00:14:11,864 --> 00:14:14,298
And they're looking right at me.

111
00:14:58,904 --> 00:15:02,738
Yeah, my father taught me. I'm not
supposed to talk about him right now.

112
00:15:02,904 --> 00:15:05,577
He's doing a little bit of work
for the government, but. . . .

113
00:15:05,744 --> 00:15:09,817
My father is very, very famous.
He danced with the Rockettes.

114
00:15:10,304 --> 00:15:12,295
Sure. Would you begin, please?

115
00:15:13,784 --> 00:15:16,617
-I'll be doing "Swanee River" for you.
-Okay.

116
00:15:16,784 --> 00:15:19,252
And. . . .

117
00:15:19,424 --> 00:15:24,134
Hon? "Swanee River," please.
Hit it.

118
00:15:28,224 --> 00:15:31,819
Doris, what would you do
if you don't make it?

119
00:15:32,384 --> 00:15:33,419
We'll make it.

120
00:15:33,984 --> 00:15:36,054
Next, please.

121
00:15:36,544 --> 00:15:39,342
But I that am not shaped
for sportive tricks. . .

122
00:15:39,504 --> 00:15:42,302
. . .nor made to court
an amorous looking glass. . .

123
00:15:42,464 --> 00:15:45,501
. . .I that am-- Cheated of--
Oh, I'm sorry.

124
00:16:01,304 --> 00:16:03,420
Why don't you try
the drama department.

125
00:16:03,624 --> 00:16:08,698
If again "it was not well cut,"
he'd answer, I spake not true:

126
00:16:08,864 --> 00:16:11,094
This is called the Reply Churlish.

127
00:16:11,424 --> 00:16:14,302
Nobody talks about it,
but there's a quota system.

128
00:16:14,464 --> 00:16:19,174
Your chances are better if you're black,
Puerto Rican or everything, like me.

129
00:16:19,344 --> 00:16:23,462
-I am Puerto Rican.
-Not on your paper you ain't, Garci.

130
00:16:23,624 --> 00:16:27,253
-Your daddy doing government work.
-That's the truth.

131
00:16:27,544 --> 00:16:31,537
And he left you his tap shoes, right?
Does he work for Pepsi-Cola too?

132
00:16:32,224 --> 00:16:33,259
Be careful.

133
00:16:33,504 --> 00:16:36,064
-To the left. Left.
-Come the other way.

134
00:16:36,224 --> 00:16:37,816
All right.

135
00:16:37,984 --> 00:16:40,498
Easy, now. Straight back, Bruno?

136
00:16:42,264 --> 00:16:45,142
-Where do you want this at?
-Far corner.

137
00:16:47,504 --> 00:16:49,301
How do you do?

138
00:16:49,504 --> 00:16:51,256
Okay. Fine.

139
00:16:51,424 --> 00:16:55,497
Great. Look, I'll do that. You just go
and get the rest of the stuff, okay?

140
00:16:55,664 --> 00:16:57,655
Oh, Martelli. Bruno Martelli.

141
00:16:57,984 --> 00:17:01,181
Would you like to set up
your equipment, Mr. Martelli?

142
00:17:06,304 --> 00:17:07,817
Who taught you?

143
00:17:07,984 --> 00:17:13,502
Who taught me? My father taught me.
He's in Spain. He makes Westerns.

144
00:17:13,664 --> 00:17:17,816
-Why do you want to go to school here?
-Because Freddie went here.

145
00:17:18,064 --> 00:17:21,852
-Freddie?
-Freddie Prinze. He's the best.

146
00:17:22,024 --> 00:17:25,619
-So you want to be an actor, huh?
-Yeah, sure, I want to be an actor.

147
00:17:25,784 --> 00:17:28,218
Judy, Judy, Judy.
Top of the world, Ma.

148
00:17:28,384 --> 00:17:32,855
We don't want you to perform. We want
to see who you are. You understand?

149
00:17:33,184 --> 00:17:35,334
-Right.
-Use your own experience.

150
00:17:35,704 --> 00:17:38,537
Be simple, be honest,
but most of all, be yourself.

151
00:17:39,144 --> 00:17:42,898
-Be honest. Be simple. Be yourself?
-Be yourself.

152
00:17:44,344 --> 00:17:48,542
I'm God, see? And God
is Puerto Rican, you got that? Now.

153
00:17:49,104 --> 00:17:53,097
God works in a casa de steam,
you know. It's a steam bath, right?

154
00:17:53,264 --> 00:17:59,134
And he's talking to this angel. This angel
is a computer. An electronic computer.

155
00:17:59,304 --> 00:18:03,934
I'm God, see? That's why I'm standing
on this chair, you got that? Good.

156
00:18:13,024 --> 00:18:16,380
Does he wanna be a musician
or an airline pilot?

157
00:18:17,424 --> 00:18:21,178
Mr. Martelli. We are ready when you are.
Would you care to begin?

158
00:18:21,384 --> 00:18:23,898
Oh, okay. Sure.

159
00:18:47,864 --> 00:18:48,853
Mr. Martelli.

160
00:18:51,224 --> 00:18:53,101
Mr. Martelli.

161
00:18:57,024 --> 00:18:58,139
Mr. Martelli!

162
00:19:00,064 --> 00:19:03,579
Thank you. One instrument
at a time will be quite sufficient.

163
00:19:03,784 --> 00:19:06,457
I could do it in 4/4
if you prefer a disco beat.

164
00:20:31,584 --> 00:20:34,144
She's a disaster.

165
00:20:37,184 --> 00:20:42,736
Romeo, wherefore art thou Romeo?
Deny thy father and refuse thy name.

166
00:20:42,904 --> 00:20:45,657
Or, if thou wilt not,
be but sworn my love. . .

167
00:20:45,824 --> 00:20:50,454
. . .and then I'll no longer be a Capu--
Capu-- Capu-something.

168
00:20:50,624 --> 00:20:54,697
-Capulet.
-Like Cappelletti, the football player?

169
00:20:54,864 --> 00:20:56,934
-Something like that.
-That's what I mean.

170
00:21:01,144 --> 00:21:04,102
-Where's his application?
-He doesn't have one.

171
00:21:04,264 --> 00:21:06,380
Well, get him one.

172
00:21:23,784 --> 00:21:26,617
-What do you call that?
-Wicked.

173
00:21:38,784 --> 00:21:40,183
Thou art thyself.

174
00:21:40,344 --> 00:21:43,416
Thou art not a Montagoo--
Montagazz-- Who knows?

175
00:21:43,584 --> 00:21:49,102
This is the last day of auditions. We've
seen a lot of students. We're punchy.

176
00:21:49,304 --> 00:21:54,583
We're gonna take a break. Go next door
to Mrs. Shime. Have her audition you.

177
00:21:54,744 --> 00:21:57,736
-Right next door.
-I tell her that you sent me?

178
00:21:57,904 --> 00:21:59,735
-Yeah.
-All right.

179
00:21:59,904 --> 00:22:01,257
By the way. . .

180
00:22:01,424 --> 00:22:05,417
-. . .you were reading the girl's part.
-Shit.

181
00:22:06,504 --> 00:22:10,292
-You're not into high school, remember?
-I'm into dancing.

182
00:22:10,464 --> 00:22:15,584
You're into ass, you mean. You don't
have to go to high school for that.

183
00:22:15,744 --> 00:22:20,534
-I was doing you a favor, remember?
-Some fat fucking favor.

184
00:22:21,704 --> 00:22:27,097
Take your things to the third floor.
Give your forms to the senior there.

185
00:22:27,424 --> 00:22:31,895
Okay, you go downstairs, change
in the girls' room and wait for him.

186
00:22:32,064 --> 00:22:35,261
I'm through?
I don't have to dance anymore?

187
00:22:35,424 --> 00:22:38,302
Where you going, Leroy?
He's in and I'm out, right?

188
00:22:38,504 --> 00:22:44,295
Fuck you, Leroy! This was my audition,
remember? You're not into high school.

189
00:22:44,464 --> 00:22:49,822
We were rehearsing to get me into this
school, not you, you fucker! It's not fair!

190
00:22:49,984 --> 00:22:53,579
I didn't want to come here anyway.
This school sucks.

191
00:22:53,784 --> 00:22:55,900
You've done me a favor, shithead.

192
00:22:56,104 --> 00:23:00,177
You saved me four fucking years
from this ass-licking school!

193
00:23:00,384 --> 00:23:03,581
You looking at one happy lady!

194
00:23:04,784 --> 00:23:08,379
Who wants to go to a fucking school
to learn to dance, anyway?

195
00:23:10,104 --> 00:23:11,742
Yeah, hello?

196
00:23:11,904 --> 00:23:17,183
No, it isn't. This is Naomi Finsecker
speaking. Her mother. Who is this?

197
00:23:26,504 --> 00:23:30,782
Replacement?
What do you mean, replacement?

198
00:23:34,664 --> 00:23:37,258
So is she in or is she out?

199
00:23:40,224 --> 00:23:43,341
I got in! I got in!
I got into Performing Arts!

200
00:23:47,904 --> 00:23:50,464
Doris, we're in!

201
00:24:38,624 --> 00:24:41,184
Get her out of there!

202
00:24:44,344 --> 00:24:48,053
-Hey, later on.
-All right. All right!

203
00:24:48,224 --> 00:24:50,454
See y'all later.

204
00:24:51,184 --> 00:24:54,256
-Hello.
-Hey, mama, get in the car!

205
00:24:57,984 --> 00:25:01,374
Come on, baby, come on.
Don't go to school.

206
00:25:01,544 --> 00:25:04,854
-Martelli, Bruno.
-Bruno. Come on.

207
00:25:05,024 --> 00:25:06,742
Garcia, Raul.

208
00:25:07,984 --> 00:25:11,101
-Garcia, Raul?
-It's Ralph.

209
00:25:12,704 --> 00:25:15,423
-It says Raul.
-I don't relate to that.

210
00:25:16,584 --> 00:25:19,417
-Garcia, Ralph.
-It's Garci.

211
00:25:19,584 --> 00:25:23,497
Ralph Garci. I think they
spelled it wrong on the application.

212
00:25:23,664 --> 00:25:26,132
-Garci, Ralph.
-Here.

213
00:25:28,704 --> 00:25:30,934
-MacNeil, Montgomery.
-Here.

214
00:25:31,504 --> 00:25:34,462
-Monroe, Lisa.
-Yes?

215
00:25:35,904 --> 00:25:37,019
Johnson, Leroy.

216
00:25:39,144 --> 00:25:40,463
Johnson, Leroy?

217
00:25:42,624 --> 00:25:47,379
In future, Mr. Johnson, I'd like you to
leave your ghetto blaster at home.

218
00:25:47,744 --> 00:25:51,259
I'd have left it home
if it wasn't so goddamn boring in here.

219
00:25:51,904 --> 00:25:57,581
This is a classroom, Mr. Johnson. You're
going to be here for four years. . .

220
00:25:57,744 --> 00:26:01,054
. . .with your eyes open,
homework done, pencils sharpened. . .

221
00:26:01,224 --> 00:26:06,776
. . .and all food, cigarettes and radios
outside. Do you understand me?

222
00:26:08,624 --> 00:26:12,333
-Why are you here, Mr. Johnson?
-Because I's young and single. . .

223
00:26:12,504 --> 00:26:15,496
-. . .and I loves to mingle.
-Speak English.

224
00:26:15,664 --> 00:26:19,976
-I speak like I likes.
-This is my room. You'll speak as I like.

225
00:26:20,144 --> 00:26:24,501
I teach English. Now, if that's
a foreign language, you're gonna learn it.

226
00:26:26,544 --> 00:26:31,538
This is no Mickey Mouse school. You
won't get off easy because of talent.

227
00:26:31,744 --> 00:26:35,703
-I don't care how well you dance. . .
-Bitch run her fucking mouth.

228
00:26:35,904 --> 00:26:39,863
. . .or how many colored tutus you have.
If you don't give academic subjects. . .

229
00:26:40,024 --> 00:26:43,733
-. . .equal time, you're out.
-Bullshit.

230
00:26:43,904 --> 00:26:47,260
You have to arrive earlier
to get dressed and warmed up.

231
00:26:47,424 --> 00:26:50,575
You have to take outside classes
in your major field. . .

232
00:26:50,744 --> 00:26:55,420
. . .and study ballet, modern, folk,
jazz, tap and historical dance here. . .

233
00:26:55,584 --> 00:26:58,257
. . .as well as dance history,
supported adagio. . .

234
00:26:58,584 --> 00:27:03,578
. . .variation class, makeup, hairstyling
and even acting for dancers.

235
00:27:03,744 --> 00:27:08,898
50,000 people call themselves actors,
and maybe 500 are making a living at it.

236
00:27:09,064 --> 00:27:13,057
Most of those do commercials to
pay the rent. The rest wait tables. . .

237
00:27:13,224 --> 00:27:17,456
. . .clean other people's apartments,
living on welfare and hope.

238
00:27:17,624 --> 00:27:19,899
Don't think talent's enough
to get you through.

239
00:27:20,064 --> 00:27:24,376
You gotta have a strong technique,
a good agent, and most of all, thick skin.

240
00:27:24,584 --> 00:27:28,657
Now you're part of an underprivileged
minority, and you're going to suffer.

241
00:27:28,864 --> 00:27:33,016
Pulled tendons, shin splints,
swollen toes, smelly tights. . . .

242
00:27:33,184 --> 00:27:36,494
Cattle calls, the humiliation,
the rejection. . . .

243
00:27:36,664 --> 00:27:41,818
Melodic dictation theory, keyboard
harmony, piano, piano literature. . .

244
00:27:41,984 --> 00:27:47,741
. . .music history, orchestration,
conducting, symphonic band. . . .

245
00:27:47,904 --> 00:27:51,419
-When do we have lunch?
-Lunch is at 1 1 :30. One half-hour. . .

246
00:27:51,584 --> 00:27:54,621
-. . .and then you'll have everything else.
-What's everything else?

247
00:27:54,784 --> 00:27:59,904
Biology, chemistry, algebra, English,
French, physics, history, et cetera.

248
00:28:00,264 --> 00:28:03,336
Dance is not a way
of getting through school.

249
00:28:03,504 --> 00:28:07,656
It's a way of life, plus school.
The school part is easier.

250
00:28:07,864 --> 00:28:12,062
So you better like yourself a lot.
Because that's all you got to work with.

251
00:28:12,224 --> 00:28:16,103
Use yourself.
Your voice, your experiences.

252
00:28:16,264 --> 00:28:21,019
Wanna accumulate some experiences?
I got plenty of experiences to spare.

253
00:28:22,584 --> 00:28:26,099
You know what?
I live with two chicks.

254
00:28:26,304 --> 00:28:29,137
Dance is the hardest
department in the school.

255
00:28:29,344 --> 00:28:31,812
Acting is the hardest
profession in the world.

256
00:28:32,024 --> 00:28:37,417
Music is the hardest profession of
them all. Isn't that right, Mrs. Tossoff?

257
00:28:37,584 --> 00:28:38,619
Indeed.

258
00:29:32,264 --> 00:29:33,822
Okay.

259
00:29:36,664 --> 00:29:39,098
No fighting. Stay in line, please.

260
00:29:40,664 --> 00:29:41,699
Who's next?

261
00:29:51,664 --> 00:29:53,382
Excuse me.

262
00:29:54,824 --> 00:29:58,863
-I'll be doing my scene Thursday. . . .
-I'll be right back.

263
00:30:04,904 --> 00:30:06,417
Get out of my seat!

264
00:33:54,704 --> 00:33:58,902
-Hi.
-Hi. That's too wild for me.

265
00:33:59,944 --> 00:34:02,617
-I'm in your acting class.
-I know.

266
00:34:02,784 --> 00:34:04,854
Montgomery MacNeil.

267
00:34:05,504 --> 00:34:08,462
-Doris Finsecker.
-Hi. Wanna sit down?

268
00:34:08,624 --> 00:34:13,061
All right. Is your mother really
Marsha MacNeil, the actress?

269
00:34:13,224 --> 00:34:15,340
-That's right.
-She does wonderful work.

270
00:34:15,664 --> 00:34:18,258
-Have you seen her?
-But I've heard.

271
00:34:20,504 --> 00:34:24,179
-I didn't know she lived in New York.
-She doesn't. Officially, she does. . .

272
00:34:24,344 --> 00:34:28,622
. . .but she's been on the road forever.
She gets paid to stay in hotels. . .

273
00:34:28,784 --> 00:34:32,697
. . .but she stays with friends. Sends her
per diems home to me and Dr. Golden.

274
00:34:32,944 --> 00:34:36,493
-Is that your stepfather?
-My analyst.

275
00:34:37,824 --> 00:34:39,940
What's wrong with you?

276
00:34:40,384 --> 00:34:43,581
It's pretty technical, really.
I have problems.

277
00:34:47,184 --> 00:34:50,460
-What kind of problems?
-With women.

278
00:34:57,224 --> 00:35:00,819
Fine. Swaying with a nice humming
sound, please. And:

279
00:35:02,664 --> 00:35:04,256
Let the arms go.

280
00:35:09,024 --> 00:35:12,221
Good, good, good.
And chew.

281
00:35:14,464 --> 00:35:15,863
Faster.

282
00:35:16,424 --> 00:35:18,380
Speed.

283
00:35:18,544 --> 00:35:21,104
Tongues out.
Down.

284
00:35:21,304 --> 00:35:22,783
Side. Side.

285
00:35:22,984 --> 00:35:25,817
And round, round.
Come on.

286
00:35:35,384 --> 00:35:37,978
More energy!

287
00:35:40,624 --> 00:35:43,422
Do it together, please.
Keep moving.

288
00:35:43,904 --> 00:35:47,658
Much better.
Much, much better now.

289
00:35:54,144 --> 00:35:55,702
Reach for the jeté!

290
00:35:56,464 --> 00:35:59,024
And:

291
00:35:59,184 --> 00:36:02,221
Impulse to impulse.

292
00:36:37,224 --> 00:36:38,623
Relax.

293
00:36:39,784 --> 00:36:41,183
Relax.

294
00:36:41,624 --> 00:36:45,060
Sense the floor against your bodies.

295
00:36:45,824 --> 00:36:48,941
Feel it against
the backs of your legs.

296
00:36:49,464 --> 00:36:51,022
Your arms.

297
00:36:51,784 --> 00:36:53,456
Your shoulders.

298
00:36:53,864 --> 00:36:56,458
Let your senses remember. . .

299
00:36:56,624 --> 00:37:00,094
. . .this feeling of heaviness.

300
00:37:00,704 --> 00:37:04,060
Relax and breathe.

301
00:37:04,864 --> 00:37:08,698
Relax and breathe.

302
00:37:10,464 --> 00:37:15,663
All right, let's go. Thank you.
Don't be late. Come on. Don't be late.

303
00:37:37,384 --> 00:37:40,217
-Should you be on this floor?
-I have a note.

304
00:37:40,384 --> 00:37:43,421
-Miss Berg wants a tambourine.
-Fine.

305
00:37:47,104 --> 00:37:50,653
Excuse me? Excuse me?
You speak English?

306
00:37:50,824 --> 00:37:52,894
-Bruno Martelli?
-He's across the hall.

307
00:37:53,064 --> 00:37:54,622
Thanks.

308
00:37:59,264 --> 00:38:01,732
-Hi.
-Hi.

309
00:38:03,424 --> 00:38:06,541
-What kind of music notes are those?
-Laser beams.

310
00:38:06,704 --> 00:38:10,458
-It's a requiem for Buck Rogers.
-Great.

311
00:38:11,184 --> 00:38:14,938
-You ever thought of doing real music?
-This is my music.

312
00:38:15,104 --> 00:38:17,982
-I mean a band.
-I don't like bands. They crowd me.

313
00:38:18,144 --> 00:38:22,376
-I prefer my basement, no people.
-There's money though, in summer trade.

314
00:38:22,544 --> 00:38:25,456
-If we get together in time.
-I'm really not interested.

315
00:38:25,624 --> 00:38:29,299
There's tea dances and parties,
weddings and bar mitzvahs.

316
00:38:29,464 --> 00:38:33,252
Those things are steady. People always
get married and grow up.

317
00:38:33,424 --> 00:38:36,382
-I don't need the hassle.
-I'll take care of everything. . .

318
00:38:36,544 --> 00:38:38,614
. . .just like a regular business manager.

319
00:38:38,784 --> 00:38:43,016
I'll look after the bookings, travel,
costume designs, for 1 0% off the top.

320
00:38:43,184 --> 00:38:45,254
Then a straight split
of the performing cut.

321
00:38:45,424 --> 00:38:49,383
-What costume designs?
-Nothing fancy, just sequins and stuff.

322
00:38:49,544 --> 00:38:52,854
See-through for me, maybe low-cut.
We gotta give them visuals.

323
00:38:53,024 --> 00:38:58,144
The sound might be wicked, but when
you get down to it, tits book bands.

324
00:38:58,304 --> 00:39:02,058
-I think I'll stay in my basement.
-Bruno, this is our chance.

325
00:39:02,224 --> 00:39:07,582
-Don't you want success?
-Sure. I don't think our tits are up to it.

326
00:39:12,864 --> 00:39:14,536
Why?

327
00:39:15,504 --> 00:39:18,098
Oh, why?

328
00:39:20,024 --> 00:39:23,733
God will punish you,
Yuri Yajeyopeyonoff.

329
00:39:25,024 --> 00:39:28,221
What crime is this unborn
child guilty of. . .

330
00:39:28,384 --> 00:39:31,296
. . .that it should not drink of
the milk of paradise?

331
00:39:31,464 --> 00:39:35,173
You warned me, Elena.
Not one ruble have I lost, not one.

332
00:39:39,224 --> 00:39:43,740
-Can we try this again? It sounds phony.
-I don't wanna try this again.

333
00:39:43,904 --> 00:39:47,783
-There's nothing wrong with you.
-I know. That's what's wrong with me.

334
00:39:47,944 --> 00:39:53,496
Everybody here is colorful or eccentric
or charismatic. I'm perfectly ordinary.

335
00:39:53,664 --> 00:39:59,216
My nose is ordinary. My body's ordinary.
And my voice, it's--

336
00:39:59,744 --> 00:40:02,383
-I don't know why I'm here.
-You wanna be an actress.

337
00:40:02,544 --> 00:40:06,822
Yeah, but actors and actresses
are colorful, flamboyant beings.

338
00:40:07,104 --> 00:40:10,255
I'm about as flamboyant as a bagel.

339
00:40:10,784 --> 00:40:11,978
Hi.

340
00:40:12,144 --> 00:40:14,135
-Hi.
-Hi.

341
00:40:14,784 --> 00:40:17,821
-Some people like bagels.
-Some people don't.

342
00:40:17,984 --> 00:40:21,101
-Some people are too old for you.
-He smiles at me.

343
00:40:21,264 --> 00:40:24,222
-He smiles at everyone.
-Yeah, but he winks too.

344
00:40:24,384 --> 00:40:27,581
-I think it's a nervous habit.
-He talks to me, often.

345
00:40:27,864 --> 00:40:30,583
-Really? What's he say?
-Hi.

346
00:40:30,864 --> 00:40:33,936
That's serious. Have you set the date?

347
00:40:37,064 --> 00:40:39,020
I'm sorry.

348
00:40:39,984 --> 00:40:42,259
-I'm sorry.
-I feel stupid.

349
00:40:42,424 --> 00:40:43,459
So get into it.

350
00:40:43,624 --> 00:40:45,854
Study it. Try to remember it
so you can--

351
00:40:45,984 --> 00:40:46,973
Hey, M and M.

352
00:40:47,144 --> 00:40:48,896
Seen your shrink lately?

353
00:40:49,184 --> 00:40:51,744
-Yesterday.
-You got a special delivery?

354
00:40:52,144 --> 00:40:53,862
How you doing? How are you?

355
00:40:55,184 --> 00:40:57,823
Oh, good. That's very good.
You're a good man.

356
00:40:58,624 --> 00:41:01,184
They're not for me.
They're for a friend of mine.

357
00:41:02,904 --> 00:41:04,337
Who's the lucky fella, huh?

358
00:41:04,944 --> 00:41:08,175
Looks like somebody finally
corked up old Finsecker.

359
00:41:08,504 --> 00:41:11,098
It can't be Gloria over here.
He's not into chicks.

360
00:41:14,864 --> 00:41:16,217
Shut my mouth.

361
00:41:17,784 --> 00:41:18,773
Bye.

362
00:41:20,104 --> 00:41:22,493
I hate Ralph Garci, I really do.

363
00:41:22,944 --> 00:41:25,504
I must remember this feeling
and use it in my acting.

364
00:41:28,624 --> 00:41:29,818
I'm scared.

365
00:41:29,984 --> 00:41:34,455
I'm scared I won't be able to live up
to their expectations of me.

366
00:41:36,744 --> 00:41:39,053
Flashing images of passion--

367
00:41:42,184 --> 00:41:46,143
--and hurl you to the ground
and make mad, passionate love.

368
00:41:47,104 --> 00:41:49,015
-I forgot it!
-For two weeks?

369
00:41:49,184 --> 00:41:52,062
-I told you, I done it and I forgot it.
-My hearing's fine.

370
00:41:52,224 --> 00:41:56,297
It's your homework that's missing.
And these pages are unintelligible.

371
00:41:57,104 --> 00:42:00,141
It's a secret language.
It ain't meant for whiteys.

372
00:42:00,304 --> 00:42:02,534
-This isn't a joke.
-I got lots of jokes.

373
00:42:02,864 --> 00:42:05,298
-This is garbage!
-My pen broke.

374
00:42:05,504 --> 00:42:08,382
-It's in pencil.
-That broke too.

375
00:42:08,544 --> 00:42:11,183
You can't learn to read,
you can't learn to dance.

376
00:42:11,424 --> 00:42:13,654
You're flunking out.

377
00:42:13,824 --> 00:42:14,893
I can read.

378
00:42:15,064 --> 00:42:17,897
Terrific! Go ahead, surprise us.
Give him your book.

379
00:42:18,064 --> 00:42:20,339
Pay attention.
Mr. Johnson is gonna read.

380
00:42:21,264 --> 00:42:23,573
-I said I can read!
-Then read.

381
00:42:24,704 --> 00:42:26,137
-No.
-Read!

382
00:42:26,464 --> 00:42:27,738
-No!
-Read!

383
00:42:27,904 --> 00:42:29,223
No, you fucking bitch!

384
00:42:29,384 --> 00:42:33,821
What the fuck you want me to do,
asking me to read all the fucking time?

385
00:42:33,984 --> 00:42:36,373
I hate your guts. You read,
you fucking bitch!

386
00:43:42,704 --> 00:43:43,819
It's not natural.

387
00:43:43,984 --> 00:43:46,054
Get off my case, huh, Papa?

388
00:43:47,104 --> 00:43:50,938
When I was your age, Bruno,
I had a lot of girlfriends.

389
00:43:51,104 --> 00:43:53,982
-I had a different girlfriend every day.
-I got music.

390
00:43:54,944 --> 00:43:56,855
Same to you, pal! Go ahead.

391
00:43:57,024 --> 00:44:01,336
Go ahead! Oh, sure, you got music,
okay. But for what? For yourself.

392
00:44:01,464 --> 00:44:02,453
For your headset.

393
00:44:02,704 --> 00:44:06,140
I mean, do I hear it anymore?
Does your mama hear it?

394
00:44:06,304 --> 00:44:07,578
Do your friends hear it?

395
00:44:07,904 --> 00:44:09,895
Bruno, do you have friends? Huh?

396
00:44:10,064 --> 00:44:13,818
-I don't have time. I told you.
-You told me. You told me.

397
00:44:13,984 --> 00:44:16,862
It's not natural. When I was your age,
I'm telling you--

398
00:44:17,024 --> 00:44:19,902
You're not my age. Nobody's my age.
I'm ahead of my time.

399
00:44:20,064 --> 00:44:22,055
Maybe I don't think
people will like my stuff.

400
00:44:22,224 --> 00:44:26,695
How do you know what people will like?
How do they know if they don't hear it?

401
00:44:26,864 --> 00:44:30,459
Bruno, how do they recognize your talent
and give you scholarships. . .

402
00:44:30,624 --> 00:44:32,854
. . .and record contracts, son,
and awards?

403
00:44:33,184 --> 00:44:36,620
Maybe I die undiscovered,
and my ghost gets the Grammy.

404
00:44:36,784 --> 00:44:41,175
Maybe! Look, did I build you a studio
in the basement for a ghost?

405
00:44:41,344 --> 00:44:44,859
Did I spent $7000 on equipment
for a ghost?

406
00:44:45,104 --> 00:44:49,973
Does your mama cook and clean and
wear old clothes for a ghost? A ghost?

407
00:44:50,144 --> 00:44:53,420
Elton John's mom has got
six mink coats.

408
00:46:02,624 --> 00:46:08,381
"Wel-- Wel-- Welcome to. . .

416
00:47:13,984 --> 00:47:15,258
Talk about Shorofsky.

417
00:47:15,424 --> 00:47:21,056
Mr. Shorofsky does not understand any
music past Mozart when he was 2.

418
00:47:21,224 --> 00:47:23,260
They're all the same.
What do you expect?

419
00:47:24,264 --> 00:47:28,701
Graduating from P.A. is no Academy
Award. You know what I mean.

420
00:47:29,424 --> 00:47:33,178
It is better than real school. It's free,
and you don't get raped in the hallways.

421
00:47:33,344 --> 00:47:35,904
But it's still small change.

422
00:47:36,064 --> 00:47:39,261
I'm just killing time here,
waiting for my opportunity.

423
00:47:39,424 --> 00:47:42,063
It might be a movie
or a Broadway musical.

424
00:47:42,224 --> 00:47:44,784
But it's coming. I keep my eyes open.

425
00:47:44,944 --> 00:47:47,981
I read Back Stage, Show Business
and Variety.

426
00:47:48,144 --> 00:47:50,294
You see, I do the whole thing.

427
00:47:50,464 --> 00:47:53,661
Dancing's just the tip
of this iceberg.

428
00:47:53,824 --> 00:47:57,100
A friend of my sister,
she tells fortunes and stuff.

429
00:47:57,264 --> 00:48:00,620
She says I'm doing my last dance
on this dark little planet.

430
00:48:00,784 --> 00:48:02,979
So it's gotta be spectacular, you know?

431
00:48:03,144 --> 00:48:05,738
How bright our spirits
go shooting out into space. . .

432
00:48:05,904 --> 00:48:10,022
. . .depends on how much we contributed
to the earthly brilliance of this world.

433
00:48:10,184 --> 00:48:13,893
And I mean to be a major contributor.

434
00:48:15,024 --> 00:48:17,174
A sure-as-shit major contributor.

435
00:48:23,904 --> 00:48:26,543
-Can someone just--?
-She's cleaning her cleavage.

436
00:48:26,704 --> 00:48:31,016
She's taking out the lint. Oh,
that's beautiful. I wish I had a camera.

437
00:48:31,184 --> 00:48:34,335
There she is. Get out of the way.
She's gorgeous.

438
00:48:34,504 --> 00:48:36,699
Oh, now turn around, please.

439
00:48:37,024 --> 00:48:38,537
Oh, please.

440
00:48:38,704 --> 00:48:40,217
Oh, look at those tits.

441
00:48:40,544 --> 00:48:42,057
Oh, you could drown in those.

442
00:48:42,224 --> 00:48:47,423
I want you to observe yourself
doing ordinary, everyday things.

443
00:48:47,904 --> 00:48:50,464
You'll be asked to duplicate
those here in class.

444
00:48:50,624 --> 00:48:52,899
An actor must develop
an acute sense memory. . .

445
00:48:53,064 --> 00:48:57,342
. . .so concentrate on how you deal
with things in your world. . .

446
00:48:57,504 --> 00:49:01,577
. . .how you wash your face
or hold your fork or lift your cup. . .

447
00:49:01,744 --> 00:49:07,023
. . .comb your hair. Observe and study
your own mechanicalness.

448
00:49:07,184 --> 00:49:11,814
See if you can catch yourself in the
very act of doing or saying something.

449
00:49:12,944 --> 00:49:17,654
See if your actions and reactions fall into
patterns and what those patterns are.

450
00:49:17,824 --> 00:49:21,419
And in particular, pay close attention
to the physical world.

451
00:49:21,584 --> 00:49:25,577
Isolate and concentrate on the details.

452
00:49:36,944 --> 00:49:39,412
Oh, mamacita!

453
00:49:43,744 --> 00:49:45,257
Ay, caramba!

454
00:49:52,384 --> 00:49:55,820
No! No! No! Give me that!

455
00:49:55,984 --> 00:49:58,544
You must hold your bow like this,
not like that.

456
00:49:58,704 --> 00:50:00,501
It's not your dick you're holding.

457
00:50:00,664 --> 00:50:04,782
Excuse me, miss. It's a violin bow.
Hold it with a little respect, like--

458
00:50:04,944 --> 00:50:06,775
Like your dick?

459
00:50:06,944 --> 00:50:09,094
Shut up. Again.

460
00:50:38,944 --> 00:50:41,902
Watch your plié, Coco.

461
00:50:43,024 --> 00:50:46,539
Turn out the arch, Leroy.

462
00:50:47,024 --> 00:50:48,457
Nice, Neisha.

463
00:50:49,904 --> 00:50:52,020
I want to see the leg, Patrick.

464
00:50:52,184 --> 00:50:55,335
And stretch.

465
00:50:57,184 --> 00:50:58,776
Good.

466
00:51:00,144 --> 00:51:01,816
Keep it together now.

467
00:51:06,624 --> 00:51:10,458
Where's the sweat, Lisa?
You're not even trying.

468
00:51:25,024 --> 00:51:27,822
-Michael, congratulations. I heard.
-Oh, thank you.

469
00:51:27,984 --> 00:51:31,021
Don't thank me. You deserved
the award and the scholarship.

470
00:51:31,184 --> 00:51:33,493
You are the best actor in the school.

471
00:51:33,664 --> 00:51:36,462
Well, you were the best actor
in the school.

472
00:51:36,624 --> 00:51:38,774
I mean, we'll miss you.

473
00:51:38,944 --> 00:51:40,218
Well, I'll miss you too.

474
00:51:40,464 --> 00:51:41,738
-You will?
-Yeah, sure.

475
00:51:41,904 --> 00:51:44,134
-We'll keep in touch, I guess, huh?
-Yeah.

476
00:51:44,544 --> 00:51:45,897
Would you sign my yearbook?

477
00:51:46,064 --> 00:51:49,500
Yeah, all right. Do you
want me to sign my picture?

478
00:51:49,664 --> 00:51:52,178
-That'd be great.
-Oh, okay.

479
00:51:52,704 --> 00:51:54,774
-I forgot. What's your name?
-Doris Finsecker.

480
00:51:54,944 --> 00:51:57,014
-Oh, right. Doris.
-But Doris is enough.

481
00:51:57,144 --> 00:51:58,133
Oh, okay.

482
00:51:58,304 --> 00:52:00,772
-Have you decided where you're going?
-California.

483
00:52:00,944 --> 00:52:03,902
-I mean to college, the scholarship.
-I can't use it.

484
00:52:04,064 --> 00:52:06,703
-How come?
-William Morris has got big plans for me.

485
00:52:06,864 --> 00:52:09,503
-They saw me in that Senior Day show.
-You're kidding?

486
00:52:09,664 --> 00:52:12,622
-They wanna represent me.
-They're the biggest agents.

487
00:52:12,784 --> 00:52:14,775
-Yeah.
-Well, that's great!

488
00:52:16,024 --> 00:52:18,458
There's a couple of series
they think I'm right for.

489
00:52:18,624 --> 00:52:22,219
I've had a lot of really good meetings.
Everyone's very excited.

490
00:52:22,384 --> 00:52:24,944
That is so great!
I mean, Hollywood, that's like--

491
00:52:25,104 --> 00:52:30,462
Yeah. Well, here I go,
off into the sunset.

492
00:52:30,624 --> 00:52:32,774
Hey, good luck. Oh, sorry.

493
00:52:32,944 --> 00:52:36,539
I mean, break a leg,
or whatever they say.

494
00:52:38,944 --> 00:52:40,457
See you.

495
00:52:41,504 --> 00:52:43,256
Hey!

496
00:52:43,744 --> 00:52:45,177
We'll see you at Schwab's.

497
00:52:49,184 --> 00:52:50,697
Oh, God, Doris!

498
00:53:03,984 --> 00:53:06,054
She's new. I saw her arrive
in a limousine.

499
00:53:06,224 --> 00:53:08,454
A limousine? No kidding?

500
00:53:09,744 --> 00:53:12,941
-Man, I hope to fuck she's in drama.
-No way. Dance department.

501
00:53:13,104 --> 00:53:15,493
She's too beautiful. Look at that ass.

502
00:53:15,664 --> 00:53:19,657
-I don't know about her tits.
-What do you mean? What kind of tits?

503
00:53:22,224 --> 00:53:24,533
-Tits. . . . Pointy ones?
-She looks kind of flat.

504
00:53:24,704 --> 00:53:25,898
She's fucking gorgeous!

505
00:53:26,064 --> 00:53:28,214
Little-bitty ones
with nips like raisins?

506
00:53:28,384 --> 00:53:30,693
She's turning around. Look at that ass.

507
00:53:30,864 --> 00:53:33,742
-Oh, she is a dancer.
-Let me up. Let me up!

508
00:53:38,144 --> 00:53:40,533
Let me see, you fuckers.

509
00:53:49,504 --> 00:53:52,302
Last year, we worked
on simple observations.

510
00:53:52,544 --> 00:53:56,935
This year, we're going to turn
that observation inward. . .

511
00:53:57,104 --> 00:53:59,823
. . .and work on re-creating
emotional states:

512
00:53:59,984 --> 00:54:03,738
Fear, joy, sorrow, anger.

513
00:54:03,904 --> 00:54:08,898
And it'll be more difficult because you'll
have to expose more of you. . .

514
00:54:09,064 --> 00:54:11,737
. . .what's on the inside of you.

515
00:54:11,904 --> 00:54:14,702
For your first acting exercise
this year, I want you. . .

516
00:54:14,864 --> 00:54:18,061
. . .to re-create a difficult memory. . .

517
00:54:18,224 --> 00:54:22,695
. . .a painful moment when you learned
something about yourself that hurt.

518
00:54:22,864 --> 00:54:26,140
And I mean really hurt.

519
00:54:26,304 --> 00:54:28,295
And reach.

520
00:54:29,104 --> 00:54:32,062
And through. And drop.

521
00:54:32,224 --> 00:54:34,533
And back.

522
00:54:40,304 --> 00:54:42,420
Hi, I'm Lisa Monroe.

523
00:54:43,584 --> 00:54:44,858
Hilary van Doren.

524
00:54:45,184 --> 00:54:46,458
I love your coat.

525
00:54:46,624 --> 00:54:48,182
I saw that in Bendel's window.

526
00:54:49,264 --> 00:54:52,859
-My stepmother bought it for me.
-Really?

527
00:54:53,024 --> 00:54:55,902
I wouldn't mind that kind of stepmother.

528
00:54:56,544 --> 00:55:00,219
She didn't do it for me.
She wants my father to think she cares.

529
00:55:00,384 --> 00:55:03,023
Besides, she loves shopping.

530
00:55:03,184 --> 00:55:06,301
She gets multiple orgasm
every time she buys something.

531
00:55:06,784 --> 00:55:08,854
Sounds great. I think I like her.

532
00:55:09,024 --> 00:55:10,298
You can have her.

533
00:55:10,704 --> 00:55:14,060
-Where's all the sweat, Lisa?
-I'm working on it.

534
00:55:14,544 --> 00:55:16,774
You're not working on it hard enough.

535
00:55:16,944 --> 00:55:18,900
Get rid of the gum.

536
00:55:29,744 --> 00:55:31,223
Watch me.

537
00:55:33,664 --> 00:55:35,575
Lift the bow off the string, Martelli.

538
00:55:36,064 --> 00:55:38,055
Mozart wouldn't do this today.

539
00:55:38,224 --> 00:55:40,294
-Do what?
-This bowing business.

540
00:55:40,464 --> 00:55:42,341
He'd plug his keyboard into an amp. . .

541
00:55:42,504 --> 00:55:45,576
. . .and he'd have string quartets
coming out of his fingers.

542
00:55:45,904 --> 00:55:49,021
And who would play all these
science-fiction symphonies?

543
00:55:49,584 --> 00:55:51,734
-He would.
-All by himself?

544
00:55:52,144 --> 00:55:55,659
He'd overdub and mix, of course.
He wouldn't make the same old noise.

545
00:55:55,824 --> 00:55:57,655
-Noise?
-He'd sound electric.

546
00:55:57,824 --> 00:56:01,942
He'd have spacier strings and horns
and computerized bassoons.

547
00:56:02,384 --> 00:56:05,296
-One man is not an orchestra.
-Who needs orchestras?

548
00:56:05,464 --> 00:56:09,582
You can do it all with a keyboard,
an amp and enough power.

549
00:56:10,144 --> 00:56:12,419
You're going to play all by yourself?

550
00:56:12,584 --> 00:56:13,983
You don't need anybody else.

551
00:56:14,384 --> 00:56:17,820
That's not music, Martelli.
That's masturbation.

552
00:56:19,744 --> 00:56:22,304
See, I'm not naturally graceful.

553
00:56:22,624 --> 00:56:24,660
Grace doesn't run in our family.

554
00:56:24,824 --> 00:56:28,612
It's our genes. I've had to work
so hard to come this far.

555
00:56:28,784 --> 00:56:31,582
-God, I've been at it since I was 4.
-Me too.

556
00:56:31,744 --> 00:56:33,655
I started out with tap and stuff.

557
00:56:33,824 --> 00:56:37,658
Then my mom kept buying me pretty
ballet tutus, and I got hooked on it.

558
00:56:37,824 --> 00:56:40,543
Less lip, Monroe! More sweat!

559
00:56:41,104 --> 00:56:43,334
-She's just a bitch.
-She hates me.

560
00:56:43,504 --> 00:56:47,053
This is a dance class, Lisa,
not the Charles Atlas plan.

561
00:56:47,344 --> 00:56:50,541
-Shut your mouth.
-Where are your tights?

562
00:56:50,784 --> 00:56:52,775
I told you I got them.
I just forgot them.

563
00:56:52,944 --> 00:56:54,536
What's he talking about?

564
00:56:54,704 --> 00:56:56,774
Tights. He won't wear them.

565
00:56:58,064 --> 00:57:02,615
Look, Leroy, I told you, if you don't have
tights, you don't dance. Now go!

566
00:57:06,224 --> 00:57:08,340
Oh, I love your accent.
What did you say?

567
00:57:08,504 --> 00:57:10,062
I dig his black ass.

568
00:57:10,224 --> 00:57:14,536
-It's taken, Goldilocks.
-Don't count on it.

569
00:57:24,624 --> 00:57:25,898
A painful memory.

570
00:57:26,064 --> 00:57:28,703
What does he mean by
a painful memory?

571
00:57:28,864 --> 00:57:31,173
I don't know. I can't find
a painful memory.

572
00:57:31,344 --> 00:57:32,697
I know I have them.

573
00:57:32,864 --> 00:57:35,662
I mean, my pain's as good
as anybody else's.

574
00:57:35,824 --> 00:57:38,941
I have lots of them. You can borrow
one of mine if you want.

575
00:57:39,104 --> 00:57:43,575
Like, I used to wet my bed. There, that
was painful. You can have that memory.

576
00:57:43,744 --> 00:57:45,018
No, thank you.

577
00:57:45,184 --> 00:57:49,018
Then there was the last time my father
packed his bags and left us.

578
00:57:49,184 --> 00:57:51,015
That really was painful.

579
00:57:51,184 --> 00:57:56,702
Or the first time my mother flew to L.A.
and didn't come back for six weeks.

580
00:57:56,944 --> 00:57:59,663
Or the first time I fell in love.

581
00:57:59,824 --> 00:58:02,133
Where'd that come from?

582
00:58:02,704 --> 00:58:04,695
I'll buy you a cup of coffee.

583
00:59:37,504 --> 00:59:39,096
You're gonna tell everybody that?

584
00:59:39,744 --> 00:59:42,133
It's the most painful memory
I can think of.

585
00:59:42,304 --> 00:59:44,943
He didn't say the most painful.
He just said painful.

586
00:59:45,104 --> 00:59:48,938
-We're supposed to expose ourselves.
-Imagine what Ralph Garci will say.

587
00:59:49,264 --> 00:59:53,576
A pie in the face comes with the job.
That's what my mom says. She knows.

588
00:59:53,744 --> 00:59:54,938
I don't get it.

589
00:59:55,104 --> 00:59:58,983
A real artist must never be afraid of
what other people will say about him.

590
00:59:59,144 --> 01:00:01,817
It was a time when I realized
something about myself.

591
01:00:02,064 --> 01:00:04,783
-Maybe you didn't realize it right.
-What do you mean?

592
01:00:05,024 --> 01:00:08,653
Well, I mean, everybody falls in love
with their analyst.

593
01:00:08,944 --> 01:00:11,504
There's a word for that, isn't there?

594
01:00:11,664 --> 01:00:14,053
Homosexual.

595
01:01:07,664 --> 01:01:09,336
That's my music.

596
01:01:09,504 --> 01:01:11,256
That lunatic stole my tape.

597
01:01:20,624 --> 01:01:22,023
Wow, that's me.

598
01:01:23,344 --> 01:01:28,702
That's my son's music!
My son Bruno. Bruno Martelli!

599
01:01:28,864 --> 01:01:32,777
He wrote the music.
Today, 46th Street. . .

600
01:01:32,944 --> 01:01:36,095
. . .tomorrow, Madison Square Garden.

601
01:01:41,344 --> 01:01:44,177
-Papa, what are you doing?
-Bruno!

602
01:01:44,344 --> 01:01:47,575
You've lost your mind. You're crazy.
Those tapes aren't ready.

603
01:01:47,744 --> 01:01:50,941
Look at the people.
They don't know it's not ready.

604
01:01:51,104 --> 01:01:54,983
Look at it, they like it!
Bruno, they like it! Bruno!

605
01:02:23,264 --> 01:02:26,097
-Hey, yo!
-Huh?

606
01:02:26,264 --> 01:02:29,973
Move your fucking parade!
What do you think this is, 5th Avenue?

607
01:02:30,144 --> 01:02:31,896
Back it up!

608
01:02:32,064 --> 01:02:37,934
I'll get your ass, buddy!
Who do you think you are?

609
01:02:44,704 --> 01:02:47,457
You're next, you hear me?

610
01:02:47,624 --> 01:02:50,263
Get away from there.
What are you doing?

611
01:02:50,424 --> 01:02:51,903
How do you like that?

612
01:02:52,064 --> 01:02:54,259
Pick that up, you son of a bitch!

613
01:03:29,497 --> 01:03:32,694
I thought I was just
going through a stage.

614
01:03:33,977 --> 01:03:36,127
That's what everyone told me.

615
01:03:36,297 --> 01:03:39,209
And it never
worried me when I was 1 0.

616
01:03:40,177 --> 01:03:44,693
Except they told me the same thing
at 1 2 and 1 4.

617
01:03:47,457 --> 01:03:52,485
So finally, my analyst
leveled with me.

618
01:03:52,737 --> 01:03:56,173
He said it was probably a life choice.

619
01:04:01,857 --> 01:04:03,734
It's funny.

620
01:04:05,577 --> 01:04:10,446
"Gay" used to mean
such a happy kind of word once.

621
01:04:12,137 --> 01:04:17,257
Not that it bothers me.
I'm pretty well-adjusted, really.

622
01:04:19,137 --> 01:04:21,093
I mean. . .

623
01:04:23,857 --> 01:04:26,610
. . .never being happy. . .

624
01:04:26,977 --> 01:04:30,287
. . .isn't the same as being unhappy.

625
01:04:30,537 --> 01:04:32,607
Is it?

626
01:04:34,937 --> 01:04:38,134
Dr. Golden explains it real well.

627
01:04:39,337 --> 01:04:41,134
He explains everything well.

628
01:04:45,137 --> 01:04:46,616
I've had a lot of help.

629
01:04:57,537 --> 01:05:01,496
Hey, Doris, you wanna go to
The Rocky Horror Show tomorrow night?

630
01:05:01,657 --> 01:05:02,851
That sounds great.

631
01:05:03,017 --> 01:05:07,090
It starts at midnight, so you better
check it out with your mom.

632
01:05:07,257 --> 01:05:10,932
Calling Montgomery MacNeil.

633
01:05:11,097 --> 01:05:14,055
Oh, Montgomery.

634
01:05:20,217 --> 01:05:23,254
I suppose that a fuck
is out of the question?

635
01:05:23,417 --> 01:05:26,250
There he is, Ralph Garci,
right on the button.

636
01:05:26,417 --> 01:05:28,453
-Nice.
-Get off!

637
01:05:28,617 --> 01:05:33,486
-I warned you this would happen.
-It's your case, man. I don't give a fuck.

638
01:05:33,657 --> 01:05:36,615
-It's a joke, that's all. It just came out.
-Like me.

639
01:05:36,777 --> 01:05:40,929
Yeah. Hey, Doris, listen,
I meant to tell you.

640
01:05:41,097 --> 01:05:45,170
There's an open call for a movie
at the Diplomat Hotel.

641
01:05:45,337 --> 01:05:48,568
-Oh, yeah?
-They're looking for your type.

642
01:05:48,737 --> 01:05:51,376
-What's my type?
-You know, your type.

643
01:05:51,537 --> 01:05:55,735
-Irishy, Jewishy, paranoid.
-What's the name of this movie?

644
01:05:55,897 --> 01:06:00,049
-I Was a Teenage Fag Hag.
-You shit!

645
01:06:03,417 --> 01:06:04,406
Stop it!

646
01:06:04,577 --> 01:06:07,296
I never knew it would
be like this, Doris.

647
01:06:07,457 --> 01:06:11,336
Oh, come closer, sweetheart.
Oh, my, such embrace.

648
01:06:16,657 --> 01:06:19,569
The Silvermans know
some very important people.

649
01:06:19,737 --> 01:06:23,412
They really have connections.
They're mishpoche with Soupy Sales.

650
01:06:23,577 --> 01:06:26,296
Oh, listen.
Your nice white blouse is ironed.

651
01:06:26,457 --> 01:06:29,733
Or you could wear your pink dress
with the ribbons.

652
01:06:29,897 --> 01:06:32,809
-You look so pretty in that.
-I hate that pink dress.

653
01:06:32,977 --> 01:06:35,696
-So don't wear your pink dress.
-I'm not going, Mama!

654
01:06:35,897 --> 01:06:37,774
-Then gargle.
-I'm going out to dinner!

655
01:06:37,937 --> 01:06:40,690
-It's a catered affair.
-It's not the food!

656
01:06:40,937 --> 01:06:43,167
This is an opportunity to perform.

657
01:06:43,337 --> 01:06:46,215
-Take advantage of it.
-I promised Montgomery!

658
01:06:46,377 --> 01:06:49,255
Well, I promised the Silvermans!

659
01:06:52,137 --> 01:06:55,812
It's a party, Doris.
They need a singer.

660
01:06:55,977 --> 01:07:00,653
And you, you need exposure.
So you're going.

661
01:07:01,137 --> 01:07:03,048
I'm not!

662
01:07:47,457 --> 01:07:51,052
Very good, Doris.
What did you realize about yourself?

663
01:07:52,937 --> 01:07:56,930
I don't like birthday parties.
Or pink dresses.

664
01:07:57,857 --> 01:08:01,054
Or the Silvermans. Or Brooklyn.

665
01:08:01,217 --> 01:08:03,606
Or even being Jewish.

666
01:08:03,897 --> 01:08:05,489
I mean, it's not bad. . .

667
01:08:06,177 --> 01:08:08,566
. . .but it's not all I am.

668
01:08:08,737 --> 01:08:12,935
I don't know who I am,
and I never will if I don't assert myself.

669
01:08:13,097 --> 01:08:17,409
I'm 1 6 years old.
I've got to assert myself sometime.

670
01:08:19,737 --> 01:08:21,409
Don't l?

671
01:08:21,817 --> 01:08:23,853
Okay, Doris. Ralph?

672
01:08:25,777 --> 01:08:28,530
I was coming home from
school one day.

673
01:08:28,697 --> 01:08:29,891
As usual.

674
01:08:30,617 --> 01:08:35,372
I had a couple of pieces of business
to attend to in the neighborhood.

675
01:08:36,497 --> 01:08:38,567
It was January.

676
01:08:39,057 --> 01:08:41,366
It was snowing like crazy.

677
01:08:44,057 --> 01:08:47,094
Santa Claus just ripped
everybody off.

678
01:08:47,577 --> 01:08:50,535
He split for Toy Town or lgloo City. . .

679
01:08:50,697 --> 01:08:53,814
. . .or the North Pole
or wherever the hell he goes.

680
01:08:56,377 --> 01:08:58,413
So anyway. . . .

681
01:08:59,577 --> 01:09:02,455
I was going home, and. . . .

682
01:09:04,577 --> 01:09:06,568
I found this note.

683
01:09:06,977 --> 01:09:09,445
It said my two chicks were in church.

684
01:09:09,617 --> 01:09:12,848
What the hell are my two chicks
doing in church?

685
01:09:14,137 --> 01:09:16,367
Somebody die or something?

686
01:09:18,657 --> 01:09:23,287
That was. . . . That was a joke.
That was supposed to be a joke.

687
01:09:29,817 --> 01:09:33,207
Anyway, I went home.

688
01:09:35,977 --> 01:09:40,971
I dropped a little incense like
I always do, just to unwind a little bit.

689
01:09:43,417 --> 01:09:45,977
And I put on the TV set.

690
01:09:48,777 --> 01:09:51,814
And there was
this guy on the TV.

691
01:09:54,897 --> 01:09:57,411
And he was talking
about Freddie.

692
01:10:00,617 --> 01:10:04,371
He. . . . He said that. . . .

693
01:10:05,977 --> 01:10:11,529
He said that Freddie Prinze
put a gun to his head. . .

694
01:10:11,697 --> 01:10:15,656
. . .and he killed himself.

695
01:10:19,057 --> 01:10:22,254
You know, it was an accident, man.

696
01:10:23,777 --> 01:10:27,406
Shit, I mean, he was fucking. . . .
He was very gifted.

697
01:10:28,417 --> 01:10:33,411
You always laughed at him
because he was very fucking talented.

698
01:10:36,577 --> 01:10:40,286
And sometimes you didn't even
wanna laugh at him. . .

699
01:10:40,457 --> 01:10:42,448
. . .and you laughed at him anyway.

700
01:10:43,297 --> 01:10:45,333
But those motherfuckers. . .

701
01:10:45,497 --> 01:10:48,216
. . .they had to say that
he was depressed. . .

702
01:10:48,377 --> 01:10:51,813
. . .and he was suicidal,
and that he was fucked up.

703
01:10:51,977 --> 01:10:56,528
They wanted his fucking ass, man.
They wanted to nail his ass.

704
01:10:56,697 --> 01:11:00,656
Because he didn't think living
was such a happy trip, you know?

705
01:11:02,257 --> 01:11:05,647
We can't have happy people
walking on this planet.

706
01:11:05,817 --> 01:11:08,729
Everybody's gotta be
so goddamn serious.

707
01:11:08,897 --> 01:11:11,252
Everyone's gotta stay in business. . .

708
01:11:11,417 --> 01:11:15,729
. . .and suffer so the witch doctors
and the deodorant-spray people. . .

709
01:11:15,897 --> 01:11:19,014
. . .and plastic surgeons
could stay in business.

710
01:11:19,177 --> 01:11:22,931
And we can all go fucking pray
to the asshole God up there. . .

711
01:11:23,097 --> 01:11:26,009
. . .that fucked it up
in the first place!

712
01:11:30,457 --> 01:11:34,291
Does all this make you
realize anything about yourself?

713
01:11:34,577 --> 01:11:37,967
-What?
-How does it affect you?

714
01:11:39,057 --> 01:11:41,287
How does it affect me?

715
01:11:42,257 --> 01:11:45,010
I'm here,
and I'm in this fucking school.

716
01:11:45,177 --> 01:11:48,089
And I'm fucking everybody back
for Freddie!

717
01:11:48,257 --> 01:11:50,009
Take it easy, Ralph.

718
01:11:50,177 --> 01:11:53,374
You want them laughing
with you, not at you.

719
01:11:53,697 --> 01:11:55,688
I don't want them laughing.

720
01:12:07,577 --> 01:12:09,090
Leroy?

721
01:12:09,777 --> 01:12:10,766
Ma'am?

722
01:12:11,257 --> 01:12:13,407
What are you wearing, Leroy?

723
01:12:13,817 --> 01:12:16,695
-A hat.
-On your feet, Leroy.

724
01:12:16,857 --> 01:12:20,850
Oh, those. You like them? They get me
to class quicker, get more learning in.

725
01:12:21,017 --> 01:12:23,736
-What about your book report?
-I done it.

726
01:12:23,897 --> 01:12:26,934
-You did it.
-1 000 words. I counted them too.

727
01:12:27,097 --> 01:12:30,453
-The Best of Playboy isn't a book report.
-It's reading, ain't it?

728
01:12:30,617 --> 01:12:35,372
So is 1984, Huckleberry Finn,
Great Expectations. You heard of those?

729
01:12:35,537 --> 01:12:37,334
I seen a couple of the movies.

730
01:12:37,497 --> 01:12:40,534
If you don't read,
you're missing so much.

731
01:12:40,697 --> 01:12:46,249
-I don't like reading. It's not my style.
-Then try Othello. He's black.

732
01:12:46,497 --> 01:12:49,648
-1 000 words in two weeks.
-Or what?

733
01:12:49,817 --> 01:12:53,446
Or you'll skate right out of
this school, Mr. Johnson.

734
01:13:09,297 --> 01:13:10,969
Come in.

735
01:13:12,857 --> 01:13:16,850
-Miss Berg, you wanted to see me?
-Come and sit down, Lisa.

736
01:13:22,937 --> 01:13:25,576
You're not working hard enough, Lisa.

737
01:13:26,057 --> 01:13:28,696
Well, I've been sick.

738
01:13:29,057 --> 01:13:31,412
Dancers don't get sick.

739
01:13:32,097 --> 01:13:33,815
Well, my doctor told me. . .

740
01:13:33,977 --> 01:13:37,492
. . .to take it easy
for a week or two until I feel okay.

741
01:13:37,657 --> 01:13:41,775
-So now it's the doctor's fault?
-Don't you believe me?

742
01:13:41,937 --> 01:13:43,370
I believe you, Lisa.

743
01:13:43,577 --> 01:13:47,286
But I don't have room
for you in this class anymore.

744
01:13:47,457 --> 01:13:49,766
But I brought a doctor's note.

745
01:13:49,937 --> 01:13:53,646
There are too many other girls
who take dance seriously. . .

746
01:13:53,817 --> 01:13:56,968
. . .to waste time and space
on someone who isn't dedicated.

747
01:13:57,137 --> 01:14:01,130
-But I am dedicated.
-I'm sorry, Lisa. I don't see it.

748
01:14:01,937 --> 01:14:04,531
I got into this school, didn't l?

749
01:14:04,697 --> 01:14:08,212
We made a mistake.
Sometimes it just doesn't work out.

750
01:14:08,377 --> 01:14:11,449
-You'll get over it.
-I'll work harder.

751
01:14:11,617 --> 01:14:14,290
-Maybe.
-I promise I'll be better.

752
01:14:14,457 --> 01:14:16,527
Better isn't good enough.

753
01:14:16,697 --> 01:14:20,815
I don't think you'll ever
be good enough. You don't have it.

754
01:14:20,977 --> 01:14:26,051
That's a hard thing to hear, and it's not
pleasant to say, but it's the truth.

755
01:14:26,217 --> 01:14:29,926
I'm saving you a lot of time and pain
by saying it now.

756
01:14:30,417 --> 01:14:33,090
I don't wanna be the best.

757
01:14:33,817 --> 01:14:36,854
-Well, you won't be.
-I just wanna dance.

758
01:14:38,137 --> 01:14:43,165
-Well, you'll never be a Mikhail, Lisa.
-I can't fail, Miss Berg.

759
01:14:43,337 --> 01:14:47,410
-I only ever wanted to be a dancer.
-You'll get over it.

760
01:14:47,577 --> 01:14:52,571
-What do I tell my mother?
-Have her call me and I'll explain.

761
01:16:18,057 --> 01:16:21,652
Fuck it. If I can't dance,
I'll change to the drama department.

762
01:16:22,137 --> 01:16:25,334
I tell you,
you're a fucking good actress.

763
01:16:31,697 --> 01:16:34,928
I heard the bitch came down
on her real hard.

764
01:16:35,097 --> 01:16:38,567
-So? Life comes down hard.
-She just took a real bad dump, kid.

765
01:16:40,537 --> 01:16:44,530
Better she realizes it now
than OD in some motel room at 30.

766
01:16:44,697 --> 01:16:47,336
You might show
a little more sympathy, dear.

767
01:16:47,657 --> 01:16:50,649
-I'm not "dear. "
-Evidemment.

768
01:16:50,817 --> 01:16:53,047
You're not très sensitive either.

769
01:16:53,337 --> 01:16:54,531
I'm a professional.

770
01:16:54,697 --> 01:16:58,246
A few unkind words aren't
going to bother me none.

771
01:16:58,737 --> 01:17:03,253
-I know it won't all be standing ovations.
-Certainly not for you, my dear.

772
01:17:03,897 --> 01:17:06,286
Look, I'm not "my dear. "
You can fuck "my dear. "

773
01:17:06,457 --> 01:17:10,530
Well, thank you. That might be fun.

774
01:17:13,297 --> 01:17:17,415
And that might be impossible.
He's not into vanilla.

775
01:17:17,577 --> 01:17:19,533
Might be a nice change
from black cherry.

776
01:17:19,697 --> 01:17:22,928
The darker the berry,
the sweeter the juice, honey.

777
01:17:23,097 --> 01:17:26,567
Yes, but who wants diabetes?

778
01:17:30,897 --> 01:17:34,287
I mean, you don't understand.
Listen to me, man.

779
01:17:34,457 --> 01:17:37,813
Diction. Watch your diction, Ralph.
You're slurring your words.

780
01:17:37,977 --> 01:17:42,607
Wait a minute. Wait a minute.
Marlon Brando slurred his words.

781
01:17:42,777 --> 01:17:45,928
Montgomery Clift and
James Dean slurred their words.

782
01:17:46,097 --> 01:17:50,056
They were the greatest actors in the
world. Nobody could understand them.

783
01:17:51,217 --> 01:17:53,447
Wait a second. What's so funny?

784
01:18:04,377 --> 01:18:08,131
Hey, it's Raul.
Where's my two chicks, huh?

785
01:18:15,417 --> 01:18:19,012
Look at you! You got so big!
Where is Mom? ls she home?

786
01:18:46,977 --> 01:18:49,127
Hey, cupcake. Come here, cupcake.

787
01:18:49,297 --> 01:18:52,972
Faggot.
That's what you are now, man.

788
01:18:53,337 --> 01:18:56,135
What you doing? Whoa! Damn, man.

789
01:19:38,897 --> 01:19:42,094
Martelli! Bruno Martelli!

790
01:19:44,777 --> 01:19:46,415
Shit!

791
01:19:51,897 --> 01:19:55,253
In the beginning
she's not in love with him--

792
01:19:55,417 --> 01:19:57,487
-God, you live here, Montgomery?
-Yeah.

793
01:19:57,657 --> 01:20:00,012
-This is a great pad.
-You like it?

794
01:20:00,177 --> 01:20:03,567
It's great. What happened to all
your furniture? You get ripped off?

795
01:20:03,737 --> 01:20:06,251
-It closed in Cincinnati.
-What's that mean?

796
01:20:06,417 --> 01:20:09,807
My mom kept saying she was gonna
fix it up when she got into a long run.

797
01:20:09,977 --> 01:20:12,537
-She's got a lousy choice in plays.
-It's perfect.

798
01:20:12,697 --> 01:20:17,168
We don't need nothing for rehearsal.
Ready when you are, Mr. Director.

799
01:20:17,337 --> 01:20:21,649
-All right, page one, Act 1 .
-All right, page one, Act 1 .

800
01:20:54,937 --> 01:20:57,132
Raul?

801
01:21:21,977 --> 01:21:24,047
Raul?

802
01:21:37,817 --> 01:21:42,288
If you're kicked around long enough,
you get to be a real professor of pain.

803
01:21:42,457 --> 01:21:46,211
I know how you feel.
But I'm having a real good time now.

804
01:21:46,377 --> 01:21:47,890
I'm enjoying myself.

805
01:21:48,057 --> 01:21:50,935
So you see, you're not such
a dog as you think you are.

806
01:21:51,097 --> 01:21:53,167
I'm having a very good time too.

807
01:21:53,337 --> 01:21:57,012
So there you are. I'm not such a dog
as I think I am.

808
01:21:57,177 --> 01:21:59,247
I think you're a very nice guy.

809
01:21:59,417 --> 01:22:02,807
I don't know why
a girl hasn't grabbed you.

810
01:22:02,977 --> 01:22:07,289
Yeah, I don't either. I am a nice guy.

811
01:22:07,537 --> 01:22:10,256
I'm also a real smart guy too.

812
01:22:18,057 --> 01:22:22,289
Wait. There's a whole speech yet.
You're not supposed to kiss yet.

813
01:22:24,937 --> 01:22:29,488
Ralph. Doris. Ralph, you have a whole
speech here you haven't even done.

814
01:22:29,657 --> 01:22:32,330
Ralph, you're not supposed to kiss yet.

815
01:22:39,257 --> 01:22:41,976
My mother was French
and very beautiful.

816
01:22:42,137 --> 01:22:47,575
Straight out of some chateau.
She danced every night for hours.

817
01:22:47,737 --> 01:22:51,571
Daddy was in Washington
or out to dinner with clients. . .

818
01:22:51,737 --> 01:22:55,093
. . .while Mom was with Tchaikovsky,
Ravel, Mantovani.

819
01:22:55,257 --> 01:22:58,806
You'll meet my stepmother, Claudia.
Trainee witch.

820
01:22:58,977 --> 01:23:02,447
No cracks about being Chinese.
She's had her eyes fixed.

821
01:23:02,617 --> 01:23:05,973
She recuperated in Palm Springs,
where she had her purse stolen.

822
01:23:06,137 --> 01:23:08,776
She lost all her credit cards.

823
01:23:09,297 --> 01:23:13,768
Dad doesn't want to report it, though.
The thief is spending less than she did.

824
01:23:21,217 --> 01:23:23,048
Hi, Daddy.

825
01:23:24,697 --> 01:23:26,016
Hi.

826
01:23:26,617 --> 01:23:29,654
Oh, this is Leroy. Homework.

827
01:26:39,497 --> 01:26:42,853
That was nice. Really.

828
01:26:43,257 --> 01:26:45,896
Sentimental shit.

829
01:26:46,777 --> 01:26:49,166
That was beautiful!

830
01:26:50,297 --> 01:26:53,334
That was beautiful.

831
01:26:53,697 --> 01:26:55,847
It was beautiful.

832
01:27:03,177 --> 01:27:06,613
-Yeah, this is it here.
-You live here?

833
01:27:06,777 --> 01:27:09,496
My sister lives here.
I'm always welcome.

834
01:27:09,657 --> 01:27:11,136
-Very nice place.
-Yeah.

835
01:27:11,297 --> 01:27:15,085
They're very fancy, huh?
I'll wait till you get inside.

836
01:27:15,257 --> 01:27:17,373
No. It's okay. Really.

837
01:27:17,537 --> 01:27:19,767
-Okay.
-It's a good neighborhood.

838
01:27:19,937 --> 01:27:24,010
-It's not much, but--
-Please, come on. That's not necessary.

839
01:27:24,177 --> 01:27:25,576
I should pay you.

840
01:27:25,737 --> 01:27:29,889
You know, I play your tapes
for my customers, you know.

841
01:27:30,057 --> 01:27:35,370
They love that stuff.
My tips go up 20%, at least.

842
01:27:36,217 --> 01:27:39,892
-And my son is happy.
-He's writing some good shit too.

843
01:27:40,057 --> 01:27:43,572
We're gonna be all over the charts
one of these days.

844
01:27:43,737 --> 01:27:48,174
-You make him happy, you know that?
-We're a hot team, you know.

845
01:27:48,337 --> 01:27:52,853
-You make him hotter. You know?
-Sure.

846
01:27:53,017 --> 01:27:57,727
I seem to have that effect on people.
What can I do? Thanks again.

847
01:27:57,897 --> 01:28:00,365
-Good night, Bruno.
-Night. Take it easy.

848
01:29:22,857 --> 01:29:24,290
You're crazy.

849
01:29:24,697 --> 01:29:25,812
You call a doctor?

850
01:29:26,137 --> 01:29:27,252
I don't think she's hurt.

851
01:29:27,537 --> 01:29:29,573
Since when are you
in the thinking business?

852
01:29:29,937 --> 01:29:31,052
She's frightened.

853
01:29:31,337 --> 01:29:34,454
-She's 5 fucking years old!
-Please keep your voice down.

854
01:29:36,377 --> 01:29:39,767
-You're in a church, my son.
-You're in the Dark Ages!

855
01:29:40,697 --> 01:29:42,369
You kiss my ass, Padre.

856
01:29:43,017 --> 01:29:47,533
She needs a doctor! A doctor!
Not the goddamn Holy Ghost!

857
01:30:11,297 --> 01:30:13,288
Is she all right?

858
01:30:17,297 --> 01:30:20,050
You're not attacked by a creep
at 5 years old and all right.

859
01:30:20,497 --> 01:30:22,089
I'm sorry.

860
01:30:22,377 --> 01:30:25,016
Doris, I wasn't there!
I wasn't fucking there!

861
01:30:25,457 --> 01:30:26,572
What about your father?

862
01:30:27,097 --> 01:30:29,327
I happen to be between
fathers right now.

863
01:30:29,497 --> 01:30:30,771
What does that mean?

864
01:30:31,417 --> 01:30:33,408
You got to understand something.

865
01:30:33,977 --> 01:30:36,810
You got to understand
the Puerto Rican woman.

866
01:30:38,537 --> 01:30:40,209
She thinks about
the kids. . .

867
01:30:40,377 --> 01:30:44,336
. . .how they gotta have a father.
Love has nothing to do with it.

868
01:30:45,177 --> 01:30:47,327
My mom has an extra room.
She rents it out.

869
01:30:47,497 --> 01:30:50,295
Next thing you know,
I've got a new father.

870
01:30:55,897 --> 01:30:59,207
They're all right, mostly.
They may stay a day. . .

871
01:30:59,657 --> 01:31:02,490
. . .or a week or a month,
if we're lucky.

872
01:31:03,137 --> 01:31:05,332
Sometimes they even pay the rent.

873
01:31:07,417 --> 01:31:09,169
They keep out all the rats.

874
01:31:10,017 --> 01:31:12,895
Not animal-type rats.
I'm talking about real rats. . .

875
01:31:13,057 --> 01:31:14,695
. . .the junkies and the winos. . .

876
01:31:14,857 --> 01:31:18,247
. . .and the shitheads
and the people who beat up. . .

877
01:31:21,937 --> 01:31:24,405
. . .Iittle 5-year-old kids.

878
01:31:27,977 --> 01:31:29,933
I got three sisters, see?

879
01:31:31,617 --> 01:31:35,530
One of them, Maria, she's
in kind of a special place.

880
01:31:36,777 --> 01:31:40,656
We see her a couple times a year.
She's got a birth defect.

881
01:31:43,657 --> 01:31:46,330
That's a goddamn lie.

882
01:31:47,977 --> 01:31:50,537
That's a goddamn lie!

883
01:31:52,137 --> 01:31:54,776
Want to know about my father?
My first fucking father?

884
01:31:54,937 --> 01:31:57,007
He ain't no special shit.

885
01:31:58,297 --> 01:32:01,653
He's in New York State Penitentiary.
He's doing time.

886
01:32:02,897 --> 01:32:05,809
I remember this one night
he got bothered. . .

887
01:32:05,977 --> 01:32:09,333
. . .because I was making her laugh.
I was telling her stories.

888
01:32:09,777 --> 01:32:13,167
It was just kid stuff.
Flying carpets and dragons.

889
01:32:13,337 --> 01:32:16,295
And he got mad
because she was laughing!

890
01:32:16,857 --> 01:32:19,325
And he said I was telling her lies.

891
01:32:19,617 --> 01:32:21,130
And this one night. . .

892
01:32:22,377 --> 01:32:24,015
. . .he got bothered.

893
01:32:25,177 --> 01:32:27,486
He's beating me
and coming down on me. . .

894
01:32:27,657 --> 01:32:29,090
. . .I said, "I make her laugh. "

895
01:32:29,257 --> 01:32:32,294
That's not a lie, that's a gift,
goddamn it.

896
01:32:33,497 --> 01:32:35,533
He can't do it.

897
01:32:36,697 --> 01:32:40,815
He said if he can't do it,
he sure as shit's gonna stop it.

898
01:32:42,377 --> 01:32:44,686
And he went for me, and. . .

899
01:32:45,537 --> 01:32:48,370
. . .she got in the way
all of a sudden, and. . .

900
01:32:49,897 --> 01:32:52,491
. . .he put her head inside a fucking wall.

901
01:32:53,337 --> 01:32:56,488
If it was my fucking head,
it would've been all right. . .

902
01:32:56,657 --> 01:32:58,773
. . .but it wasn't. It was hers!

903
01:32:59,097 --> 01:33:03,090
If it was my fucking fat head,
it would've been all right.

904
01:33:04,697 --> 01:33:07,894
She's a beautiful kid.
She's 5 fucking years old.

905
01:33:08,137 --> 01:33:13,006
She's got a pretty little laugh.
She still laughs, as a matter of fact.

906
01:34:12,337 --> 01:34:14,407
Barbra Streisand didn't
change her name.

907
01:34:14,617 --> 01:34:18,132
-I don't want to talk about it.
-I'll call you Doris, like always.

908
01:34:18,297 --> 01:34:19,412
I won't answer.

909
01:34:19,577 --> 01:34:23,252
-It's a perfectly good name.
-For a perfectly good person.

910
01:34:23,417 --> 01:34:26,727
A skinny, boring, nondescript,
perfectly good person.

911
01:34:27,057 --> 01:34:32,211
I have a lot of friends named Doris,
and they are none of those things.

912
01:34:32,457 --> 01:34:34,527
-Yeah, but they're all--
-What?

913
01:34:34,777 --> 01:34:36,847
No, no, no. Say it. Go ahead. Say it!

914
01:34:37,017 --> 01:34:41,249
I would like to know what my daughter
thinks is wrong with my friends.

915
01:34:41,417 --> 01:34:44,807
I don't want a middle-aged name.
I can't relate to it.

916
01:34:45,097 --> 01:34:46,530
You can call me Dominique.

917
01:34:46,697 --> 01:34:47,812
Dominique.

918
01:34:47,977 --> 01:34:50,207
-That's ridiculous.
-It's French.

919
01:34:50,377 --> 01:34:54,655
-I know what it is, but it's not you.
-I'll grow into it.

920
01:34:54,937 --> 01:34:58,247
-Dominique Finsecker?
-No. Dominique Dupont.

921
01:34:58,817 --> 01:35:00,853
-Sounds like a hooker.
-Oh, Mama.

922
01:35:01,017 --> 01:35:04,771
I don't know what's happening to you.
Tell me what's happening to you.

923
01:35:05,177 --> 01:35:07,247
Where did my Doris go?

924
01:35:07,577 --> 01:35:11,411
Something wonderful is happening
to me, Mama. I'm growing up.

925
01:35:12,577 --> 01:35:14,693
You're becoming somebody else.

926
01:35:14,977 --> 01:35:19,209
-I'm becoming an actress.
-I want you to be the Doris that I know.

927
01:35:19,377 --> 01:35:22,210
That I love. That helps
me with the groceries.

928
01:35:23,137 --> 01:35:25,093
Makes me birthday cards. . .

929
01:35:25,257 --> 01:35:27,566
. . .out of Cheerio packets, huh?

930
01:35:28,177 --> 01:35:29,576
Not Dominique. . .

931
01:35:29,897 --> 01:35:31,853
. . .who stays out all night.

932
01:35:32,017 --> 01:35:33,336
Oh, Mama.

933
01:35:33,537 --> 01:35:35,255
And gets pregnant.

934
01:35:35,737 --> 01:35:38,012
Or has an abortion, God forbid.

935
01:35:39,737 --> 01:35:42,809
Now, Dominique, she'd be smart.

936
01:35:43,697 --> 01:35:45,335
But my Doris. . .

937
01:35:45,857 --> 01:35:47,813
. . .she's dumb enough
to get knocked up--

938
01:35:48,177 --> 01:35:50,372
Mama, it was just one night!

939
01:35:52,217 --> 01:35:53,775
That's all it takes.

940
01:36:04,737 --> 01:36:07,968
We'd like to welcome everyone to
The Rocky Horror Picture Show. . .

941
01:36:08,137 --> 01:36:10,446
. . .here at the 8th Street Playhouse!

942
01:36:15,417 --> 01:36:18,295
And our regulars would
like to wish a warm welcome. . .

943
01:36:18,457 --> 01:36:20,846
. . .to all you virgins!

944
01:36:24,417 --> 01:36:27,056
We have some special occasions tonight.

945
01:36:27,417 --> 01:36:29,885
Tonight is Gail's birthday.

946
01:36:33,977 --> 01:36:37,811
We have a special button
for a special young lady.

947
01:36:37,977 --> 01:36:42,016
Tonight is Christine's 1 50th time!

948
01:36:52,497 --> 01:36:54,453
Let's hear it for her! Come on!

949
01:37:00,857 --> 01:37:03,815
Now, we have a special warning
from the management.

950
01:37:03,977 --> 01:37:06,889
No lit candles. No throwing
food at the screen. Understand?

951
01:37:07,137 --> 01:37:08,365
Get on with the show!

952
01:37:08,897 --> 01:37:11,411
This is the fucking show!
lf you don't like it. . .

953
01:37:11,577 --> 01:37:13,807
. . .you can go see the movie
in Staten lsland!

954
01:37:13,977 --> 01:37:17,014
Boy, is he in for a surprise tonight.

955
01:37:17,377 --> 01:37:18,969
All right, for the cheers!

956
01:37:19,137 --> 01:37:20,809
-Give me an R!
-R!

957
01:37:21,057 --> 01:37:22,536
-Give me an O!
-O!

958
01:37:22,737 --> 01:37:24,056
-Give me a C!
-C!

959
01:37:24,217 --> 01:37:26,014
-Give me a K!
-K!

960
01:37:26,177 --> 01:37:27,496
-Give me a Y!
-Y!

961
01:37:27,737 --> 01:37:29,295
-What's it spell?
-Rocky!

962
01:37:29,457 --> 01:37:31,573
-I can't hear you!
-Rocky!

963
01:37:31,817 --> 01:37:33,808
-One more time!
-Rocky!

964
01:37:33,977 --> 01:37:35,046
-Give me an E!
-E!

965
01:37:35,217 --> 01:37:36,696
-Give me an A!
-A!

966
01:37:36,857 --> 01:37:39,496
-What kind of time we gonna have?
-E-A!

967
01:39:46,857 --> 01:39:49,007
Where did that
motorcyclist come from?

968
01:39:49,177 --> 01:39:50,849
I guess we'll have to turn back.

969
01:39:57,137 --> 01:39:59,890
-What was that bang?
-Must have a blowout.

970
01:40:00,457 --> 01:40:01,731
Damn it!

971
01:40:01,897 --> 01:40:05,810
-I should have gotten that spare fixed.
-Asshole!

972
01:40:05,977 --> 01:40:08,127
Stay here and keep warm.
I'll go for help.

973
01:40:08,297 --> 01:40:10,606
Where will you go
in the middle of nowhere?

974
01:40:10,777 --> 01:40:14,133
What's white and sells hamburgers?

975
01:40:14,297 --> 01:40:17,175
Didn 't we pass a castle down the road?

976
01:40:17,457 --> 01:40:19,448
Maybe they have a telephone.

977
01:40:19,617 --> 01:40:21,175
I'm going with you.

978
01:40:25,497 --> 01:40:27,647
Kick it!

979
01:40:31,577 --> 01:40:36,207
Hey, Janet! How about fries
to go with that shake?

980
01:40:40,257 --> 01:40:42,691
Take the risk!

981
01:40:49,337 --> 01:40:52,852
Hey, Riff, show us your mother!

982
01:41:10,137 --> 01:41:11,855
Watch the film.

983
01:41:41,777 --> 01:41:43,927
How's it go?

984
01:41:59,937 --> 01:42:02,007
Oh, my God.

985
01:42:11,337 --> 01:42:13,248
-You did what?
-I got stoned.

986
01:42:13,937 --> 01:42:16,212
She took her top off.
She played with her bongos.

987
01:42:16,657 --> 01:42:18,613
-I did not!
-It was incredible!

988
01:42:18,777 --> 01:42:20,733
It was more than incredible, it was fun.

989
01:42:20,897 --> 01:42:24,492
I felt naked when people looked at me
before. But they weren't looking at me. . .

990
01:42:24,657 --> 01:42:27,649
. . .they were looking at someone
I put on. Like a costume.

991
01:42:28,017 --> 01:42:32,374
If I don't have a personality, so what?
I'm an actress.

992
01:42:32,577 --> 01:42:35,091
I can put on
as many personalities as I want.

993
01:42:35,257 --> 01:42:37,896
-To schizophrenia!
-Abso-fucking-lutely!

994
01:42:38,257 --> 01:42:41,852
-Abso-fucking-what?
-You kids ready to order now?

995
01:42:42,457 --> 01:42:44,175
-Michael?
-Yeah.

996
01:42:44,697 --> 01:42:46,335
You don't remember?

997
01:42:46,937 --> 01:42:49,007
Two years ago. I'm Doris Fin--

998
01:42:49,177 --> 01:42:52,692
I was Doris Finsecker, when
you were a senior at P.A.

999
01:42:53,217 --> 01:42:57,051
-Yeah. Around the corner.
-You remember Montgomery MacNeil. . .

1000
01:42:57,217 --> 01:42:59,412
-. . .and Ralph Garci.
-Sure. Good old days.

1001
01:42:59,977 --> 01:43:00,966
How was Hollywood?

1002
01:43:01,417 --> 01:43:02,532
Slow.

1003
01:43:02,777 --> 01:43:05,496
I met some people,
went to some parties.

1004
01:43:05,897 --> 01:43:09,173
-I did a pilot for a series.
-I didn't see it.

1005
01:43:09,377 --> 01:43:10,776
Nobody saw it.

1006
01:43:11,137 --> 01:43:12,206
Sorry.

1007
01:43:12,857 --> 01:43:16,054
-I did a couple of days as a male nurse.
-Did you?

1008
01:43:16,377 --> 01:43:18,174
On a soap.

1009
01:43:19,097 --> 01:43:21,657
-I didn't like L.A. too much.
-It sucks out there.

1010
01:43:22,017 --> 01:43:25,407
-Are you studying?
-I catch a class when I can.

1011
01:43:25,577 --> 01:43:27,215
Hard times, you know?

1012
01:43:28,057 --> 01:43:30,491
-I read for a showcase.
-Oh, really?

1013
01:43:30,657 --> 01:43:32,534
I got a callback next week.

1014
01:43:32,857 --> 01:43:34,609
-Hope you get it.
-Hey, good luck.

1015
01:43:34,977 --> 01:43:36,012
Yeah.

1016
01:43:36,577 --> 01:43:37,646
Yeah.

1017
01:43:39,417 --> 01:43:40,736
What you kids having?

1018
01:43:41,017 --> 01:43:43,212
Got a special today on fried clams.

1019
01:43:43,497 --> 01:43:46,614
-Fried clams sound great.
-Yeah, that's fine.

1020
01:43:47,497 --> 01:43:51,172
-Fried clams is great.
-Yeah, sounds good.

1021
01:43:55,257 --> 01:43:57,248
Welcome to Catch a Rising Star.

1022
01:43:58,537 --> 01:44:00,846
Did anybody know it was Monday night?

1023
01:44:01,137 --> 01:44:04,732
Monday night is audition night.
Anybody from anywhere. . .

1024
01:44:04,897 --> 01:44:06,967
. . .can come up here and do
what they want.

1025
01:44:07,137 --> 01:44:09,571
You should see what walks in the room.

1026
01:44:09,737 --> 01:44:12,854
Some of the people that started here
were David Brenner. . .

1027
01:44:13,017 --> 01:44:14,166
. . .Jimmie Walker. . .

1028
01:44:14,377 --> 01:44:18,655
. . .Gabe Kaplan, Freddie Prinze.
Maybe this next young man might. . .

1029
01:44:19,057 --> 01:44:20,695
. . .watch them on television.

1030
01:44:21,337 --> 01:44:24,727
Please welcome the comedy stylings. . .

1031
01:44:24,977 --> 01:44:27,855
. . .of Ralph Garci, ladies and gentlemen.

1032
01:44:32,497 --> 01:44:34,567
Yay, Ralph!

1033
01:44:35,377 --> 01:44:36,366
Thank you.

1034
01:44:37,097 --> 01:44:39,895
Like Richard said,
my name is Ralph Garci.

1035
01:44:40,057 --> 01:44:41,854
I'm a professional asshole.

1036
01:44:45,057 --> 01:44:48,367
I see we have a few
amateurs in the audience.

1037
01:44:49,977 --> 01:44:51,046
I have some--

1038
01:44:51,217 --> 01:44:55,733
Some. I have all of my friends here
tonight. From P.A. graduating class.

1039
01:45:00,017 --> 01:45:02,406
It's very important to have friends.

1040
01:45:03,177 --> 01:45:04,849
I live in the South Bronx.

1041
01:45:06,537 --> 01:45:09,973
That's the country just north of Harlem
and west of Puerto Rico.

1042
01:45:10,137 --> 01:45:12,173
It's a very tough neighborhood.

1043
01:45:12,337 --> 01:45:13,929
The dogs carry knives.

1044
01:45:15,897 --> 01:45:18,616
Did you ever see a baby
with a zip gun?

1045
01:45:19,297 --> 01:45:23,575
You gotta have friends. You can't
alienate anybody up there. Nobody.

1046
01:45:23,737 --> 01:45:27,252
Black people, white people, Chicanos,
Puerto Ricans, cockroaches.

1047
01:45:27,817 --> 01:45:30,536
You gotta respect cockroaches.
They got a good union.

1048
01:45:30,897 --> 01:45:35,095
Last week, 1 5,000 marched down my
block demanding better housing.

1049
01:45:37,177 --> 01:45:40,852
But I love the South Bronx.
Everywhere you go from there is up.

1050
01:45:41,857 --> 01:45:46,487
Everybody has dreams in the
South Bronx. I had dreams.

1051
01:45:46,857 --> 01:45:50,213
Stop your average boy
on a South Bronx street. . .

1052
01:45:50,977 --> 01:45:53,286
. . .and ask him
what he wants to be.

1053
01:45:53,657 --> 01:45:56,649
"I want to be an ex-junkie, man. "

1054
01:45:57,697 --> 01:45:59,494
You can see them every day.

1055
01:45:59,657 --> 01:46:03,809
You can't drive because of the dreams
on the streets being seen by cokeheads.

1056
01:46:03,977 --> 01:46:08,812
The minute that white line's laid down
the street, you got somebody going:

1057
01:46:09,977 --> 01:46:11,046
It's true.

1058
01:46:12,537 --> 01:46:15,097
And then there is sex.

1059
01:46:16,217 --> 01:46:17,570
Oh, yeah.

1060
01:46:17,937 --> 01:46:20,531
Kids are into sex earlier in South Bronx.

1061
01:46:21,497 --> 01:46:23,089
Like about 6 a.m.

1062
01:46:27,337 --> 01:46:28,895
-You were wonderful.
-No.

1063
01:46:29,057 --> 01:46:31,890
-Really.
-I was good. I felt more than good.

1064
01:46:32,057 --> 01:46:34,048
-The guy wants me back.
-You're kidding!

1065
01:46:34,217 --> 01:46:35,855
He wants to book me regularly.

1066
01:46:36,017 --> 01:46:37,370
-Great!
-That's not great. . .

1067
01:46:37,537 --> 01:46:39,607
. . .it's fantastic! It's like electricity.

1068
01:46:39,777 --> 01:46:43,213
You're out there. Those faces are
out there, staring at you. . .

1069
01:46:43,377 --> 01:46:46,653
. . .and you draw them in, then
you hit them with the juice.

1070
01:46:46,817 --> 01:46:50,856
And bam! They fucking explode!
And that power goes back and forth.

1071
01:46:51,017 --> 01:46:53,406
Next thing you know,
you're making them laugh.

1072
01:46:53,577 --> 01:46:57,047
That is the meanest high there is.
That beats dope. That beats sex.

1073
01:46:57,457 --> 01:47:00,574
I love fucking acting!

1074
01:47:00,777 --> 01:47:04,133
With my money, we can get
a place. We can get married maybe.

1075
01:47:04,297 --> 01:47:08,370
I'll have $20,000 a week, a hit
TV series, my face on TV Guide!

1076
01:47:08,537 --> 01:47:09,606
-Wait!
-What?

1077
01:47:09,777 --> 01:47:13,372
-What about me? Don't I get a career?
-A career? I'll give you a career.

1078
01:47:13,577 --> 01:47:18,526
How about Shakespeare in the Park
and you get to win 1 7 Tony awards?

1079
01:47:18,777 --> 01:47:21,575
-All right. Bye.
-All right. Okay. Bye.

1080
01:47:23,257 --> 01:47:24,849
Don't mug anybody.

1081
01:47:25,297 --> 01:47:28,209
-Don't rape anybody.
-I'll rape you.

1082
01:47:28,377 --> 01:47:29,696
Don't rape anybody, okay?

1083
01:47:29,857 --> 01:47:31,415
I'll see you later. Take care.

1084
01:47:36,377 --> 01:47:37,571
You see. . .

1085
01:47:38,737 --> 01:47:41,968
. . .I've been offered this place
with the San Francisco Ballet.

1086
01:47:42,137 --> 01:47:45,095
I haven't told anyone yet,
but I'm gonna take it.

1087
01:47:45,257 --> 01:47:47,293
I don't care what they think.

1088
01:47:47,857 --> 01:47:50,166
I'm a good dancer. Better than good.

1089
01:47:50,417 --> 01:47:52,772
Maybe even the best in the school.

1090
01:47:53,617 --> 01:47:56,893
That's not conceit.
It's just simple honesty.

1091
01:47:58,017 --> 01:48:02,374
If I stay in New York, everybody will
think I bought my way into ABT.

1092
01:48:02,657 --> 01:48:07,572
I'm not starving myself to death
for Balanchine's City Ballet.

1093
01:48:08,697 --> 01:48:11,973
Not that I mind doing
the corps de ballet bullshit.

1094
01:48:12,537 --> 01:48:14,926
I'd sooner do it out of town.

1095
01:48:16,497 --> 01:48:18,965
I'll pay my dues on the West Coast.

1096
01:48:19,777 --> 01:48:22,450
Come back to New York as a star.

1097
01:48:25,137 --> 01:48:26,286
You see. . .

1098
01:48:27,097 --> 01:48:29,565
. . .I've always had this crazy dream. . .

1099
01:48:29,737 --> 01:48:33,332
. . .of dancing all the classical
roles before I'm 21 .

1100
01:48:34,937 --> 01:48:38,771
I want Giselles and Coppélias
coming out of my feet.

1101
01:48:39,297 --> 01:48:41,253
And Sleeping Beauties. . .

1102
01:48:41,697 --> 01:48:43,608
. . .and the Swan.

1103
01:48:45,177 --> 01:48:48,089
I want bravos in Stuttgart
and Leningrad. . .

1104
01:48:48,257 --> 01:48:49,770
. . .and Paris.

1105
01:48:50,977 --> 01:48:54,287
Maybe even a ballet
created especially for me.

1106
01:48:57,497 --> 01:48:58,930
You see. . .

1107
01:48:59,577 --> 01:49:02,296
. . .there's no room for a baby.

1108
01:49:03,217 --> 01:49:06,607
Will this be Master Charge
or American Express, honey?

1109
01:49:15,057 --> 01:49:16,285
Excuse me.

1110
01:49:17,497 --> 01:49:19,169
You're an actress, aren't you?

1111
01:49:19,537 --> 01:49:20,856
I might be.

1112
01:49:21,657 --> 01:49:23,409
A Chorus Line, right?

1113
01:49:23,817 --> 01:49:27,366
Aren't you the one that does that
hot, smoky number in the red dress?

1114
01:49:27,897 --> 01:49:30,570
I'm right, ain't l? I knew it.

1115
01:49:31,097 --> 01:49:34,851
Boy, let me tell you, you are
the best thing in that show.

1116
01:49:36,417 --> 01:49:40,012
I guess you get tired of hearing that.
Excuse me.

1117
01:49:40,177 --> 01:49:41,656
No, I don't.

1118
01:49:43,097 --> 01:49:44,815
You don't belong there.

1119
01:49:45,137 --> 01:49:47,412
If you don't mind my
saying so, you're a star.

1120
01:49:47,577 --> 01:49:49,295
You need a show all to yourself.

1121
01:49:49,497 --> 01:49:53,649
-You've got a lovely face, a great figure.
-I sing too.

1122
01:49:53,817 --> 01:49:55,250
-No.
-And play the piano.

1123
01:49:55,537 --> 01:49:58,176
That's what I mean. But it's
more than just talent. . .

1124
01:49:58,337 --> 01:50:00,328
. . .it's a certain quality.

1125
01:50:00,537 --> 01:50:03,370
You're the kind of girl that
stands out in a room.

1126
01:50:03,577 --> 01:50:06,489
This might sound a little
presumptuous of me. . . .

1127
01:50:07,297 --> 01:50:09,288
I should probably
just call your agent.

1128
01:50:09,897 --> 01:50:14,015
-I don't really relate to agents.
-Don't blame you at all.

1129
01:50:14,257 --> 01:50:17,488
Listen, my name is François.
Francois Lafete.

1130
01:50:17,857 --> 01:50:18,846
Coco.

1131
01:50:19,217 --> 01:50:22,334
Coco? Coco? That's terrific!

1132
01:50:22,617 --> 01:50:26,530
Listen, Coco, I'm doing this picture
down in the south of France, you know?

1133
01:50:27,217 --> 01:50:29,651
I was wondering if. . .

1134
01:50:30,457 --> 01:50:32,925
. . .maybe you'd like to do
a screen test for me.

1135
01:50:36,657 --> 01:50:38,056
Are you serious?

1136
01:50:44,377 --> 01:50:45,810
Bunsky.

1137
01:50:46,257 --> 01:50:47,610
Hey, Bunsky.

1138
01:50:48,657 --> 01:50:49,692
You seen Sherwood?

1139
01:50:49,897 --> 01:50:51,933
She's with her husband.

1140
01:50:52,097 --> 01:50:54,691
-I didn't know she had a husband.
-He's sick, Leroy.

1141
01:50:55,057 --> 01:50:56,775
He'd have to be to be her husband.

1142
01:50:56,937 --> 01:50:59,531
He's quite bad.
In the hospital, anyway.

1143
01:50:59,697 --> 01:51:01,494
-Hospital?
-Apparently.

1144
01:51:02,017 --> 01:51:03,609
Okay, Schlepstein.

1145
01:51:30,257 --> 01:51:32,293
Leroy. What are you doing here?

1146
01:51:35,497 --> 01:51:37,169
You ever heard of Alvin Ailey?

1147
01:51:37,377 --> 01:51:38,605
Alvin Ailey?

1148
01:51:39,097 --> 01:51:40,166
He's a. . . .

1149
01:51:40,777 --> 01:51:42,210
He's a choreographer?

1150
01:51:43,337 --> 01:51:45,168
He wants me to join his company.

1151
01:51:45,337 --> 01:51:48,693
I'm sorry, Leroy, but I don't think
this is the time--

1152
01:51:48,857 --> 01:51:51,496
I can't if you flunk me out.
I have to pass.

1153
01:51:51,737 --> 01:51:53,887
You should've thought of it
four years ago.

1154
01:51:54,057 --> 01:51:56,366
Where I come from
it don't pay to read and speak white.

1155
01:51:56,537 --> 01:51:58,334
Don't lecture me, Leroy.

1156
01:51:58,897 --> 01:52:02,651
Maybe I didn't say it right, but you
been down hard on me since day one.

1157
01:52:02,817 --> 01:52:04,967
Whatever you say,
Leroy. Go home.

1158
01:52:05,137 --> 01:52:08,209
I stopped going home!
You never knew that, did you?

1159
01:52:08,377 --> 01:52:12,575
You make a big deal about pulling us out
of the gutter, yet you won't eat with us.

1160
01:52:12,737 --> 01:52:15,297
You know where that leaves people
like me? Nowhere!

1161
01:52:15,457 --> 01:52:19,450
-It isn't the time. I don't wanna hear it.
-You're going to hear it!

1162
01:52:19,617 --> 01:52:23,371
-I'm gonna be a good dancer!
-Just get out of here, please!

1163
01:52:23,617 --> 01:52:26,529
-You will not keep me down. . .
-Leave me alone!

1164
01:52:26,697 --> 01:52:31,566
-. . .because I can't read stories!
-Don't you think of anyone but yourself?

1165
01:52:50,777 --> 01:52:51,766
Hey.

1166
01:52:52,417 --> 01:52:54,248
How's your old man doing?

1167
01:52:54,857 --> 01:52:55,846
Shit.

1168
01:53:00,257 --> 01:53:01,246
Here.

1169
01:53:03,097 --> 01:53:04,610
Thank you.

1170
01:54:04,457 --> 01:54:08,655
Coco. Bonjour. You made it. Come on in.

1171
01:54:11,857 --> 01:54:14,769
-Am I early?
-Don't be silly. Let me take your coat.

1172
01:54:15,257 --> 01:54:17,327
-Where's the crew?
-You're looking at him.

1173
01:54:17,537 --> 01:54:20,574
I must have total control of
the creative product.

1174
01:54:20,737 --> 01:54:22,090
Like Godard.

1175
01:54:22,897 --> 01:54:25,969
-Jean-Luc Godard? Ever hear of that guy?
-French?

1176
01:54:28,417 --> 01:54:30,726
-You ever see any of his pictures?
-Sure.

1177
01:54:30,897 --> 01:54:32,808
Then you know what I'm talking about.

1178
01:54:33,817 --> 01:54:38,095
You see, I belong, sort of, to the
auteur school of filmmaking.

1179
01:54:38,257 --> 01:54:39,736
It's like the--

1180
01:54:39,897 --> 01:54:43,128
It's like the Mediterranean
approach, you know what I mean?

1181
01:54:44,417 --> 01:54:46,726
-Do you want a beer?
-No, thanks. I'm okay.

1182
01:54:46,897 --> 01:54:50,412
-It might relax you.
-It's all right. I have a lot on my mind.

1183
01:54:50,577 --> 01:54:51,851
I understand.

1184
01:54:53,697 --> 01:54:55,449
-What?
-Come here.

1185
01:54:56,777 --> 01:55:00,008
That's it. I want you to sit right here.

1186
01:55:00,177 --> 01:55:04,932
We're gonna do a lovely close-up
of that beautiful face.

1187
01:55:05,897 --> 01:55:09,128
I get nervous at first with cold readings,
but then I'm all right.

1188
01:55:09,297 --> 01:55:12,334
Don't worry about that.
We'll get to the dialogue later.

1189
01:55:13,097 --> 01:55:17,613
-So, you like art movies, huh, Coco?
-Antonioni and those people? Sure.

1190
01:55:17,777 --> 01:55:20,086
It beats watching Laverne & Shirley.

1191
01:55:20,257 --> 01:55:23,408
Coco, you don't know
what you're doing to my lens.

1192
01:55:25,777 --> 01:55:27,972
You have a natural rapport
with the camera.

1193
01:55:28,137 --> 01:55:31,288
It's unbelievable. Some performers
can make love to the camera.

1194
01:55:31,457 --> 01:55:32,810
Garbo did.

1195
01:55:33,217 --> 01:55:34,730
Monroe did.

1196
01:55:36,057 --> 01:55:37,206
So could you.

1197
01:55:37,577 --> 01:55:39,533
-Yeah?
-Oh, yeah.

1198
01:55:39,937 --> 01:55:42,007
Could you take your top off, please?

1199
01:55:45,617 --> 01:55:48,609
-What?
-Could you take your blouse off?

1200
01:55:50,377 --> 01:55:52,572
-Are you kidding?
-No, I'm not kidding.

1201
01:55:53,657 --> 01:55:56,455
What's the matter?
You're acting like some dumb kid.

1202
01:55:56,617 --> 01:55:58,926
-I thought you were a professional.
-I am.

1203
01:55:59,097 --> 01:56:00,974
Well, then what's the problem?

1204
01:56:12,977 --> 01:56:14,695
I can't.

1205
01:56:24,377 --> 01:56:25,605
That's better.

1206
01:56:27,097 --> 01:56:28,496
That's lovely.

1207
01:56:30,257 --> 01:56:31,849
Oh, yeah.

1208
01:56:33,617 --> 01:56:37,530
Yeah. Could you arch your back?
Arch your back a little, Coco.

1209
01:56:40,977 --> 01:56:43,093
Smile for me, Coco.

1210
01:56:43,417 --> 01:56:48,127
Come on, Coco. Smile, smile.
Smile for me.

1211
01:56:49,257 --> 01:56:50,975
Now take your thumb. . .

1212
01:56:51,137 --> 01:56:52,775
. . .and put it in your mouth. . .

1213
01:56:52,937 --> 01:56:55,371
. . .Iike a little schoolgirl.

1214
01:56:57,857 --> 01:57:00,007
You ever notice that
black news reporters. . .

1215
01:57:00,177 --> 01:57:02,896
. . .get hired because
they have white accents?

1216
01:57:03,057 --> 01:57:06,288
They should hire a more natural guy,
a dude from the street.

1217
01:57:06,697 --> 01:57:08,210
"This is Rufus X with the news. . . . "

1218
01:57:10,537 --> 01:57:12,016
I need something.

1219
01:57:12,177 --> 01:57:13,451
Sleep.

1220
01:57:14,137 --> 01:57:16,605
-Something to keep me flying.
-Like what?

1221
01:57:17,017 --> 01:57:19,690
Like by way of your witch doctor.

1222
01:57:19,977 --> 01:57:22,252
I don't see Dr. Golden anymore.
You know that.

1223
01:57:22,737 --> 01:57:24,534
Anyway, you've been taking too much.

1224
01:57:24,697 --> 01:57:27,370
-Thanks, Marcus Welby.
-I know what I'm talking about.

1225
01:57:27,537 --> 01:57:29,812
Why don't you get off my fucking case?

1226
01:57:29,977 --> 01:57:32,650
-I'm your friend.
-You're my friend? Really?

1227
01:57:32,817 --> 01:57:36,332
I know what you've been
after, you goddamn faggot.

1228
01:57:40,337 --> 01:57:42,134
I gotta go to the bathroom.

1229
01:57:43,857 --> 01:57:45,495
Good. You do that.

1230
01:57:47,377 --> 01:57:48,856
Hi. You got a problem?

1231
01:57:49,457 --> 01:57:50,731
Yeah, I do.

1232
01:57:51,177 --> 01:57:52,929
We never see you anymore.

1233
01:57:53,177 --> 01:57:54,576
You see me plenty.

1234
01:57:54,737 --> 01:57:57,126
Drinking with your new friends
after the show.

1235
01:57:57,297 --> 01:58:00,414
After the show is when
all the big names come in.

1236
01:58:00,577 --> 01:58:02,693
You meet people. That's what counts.

1237
01:58:02,857 --> 01:58:05,610
I hate drinking. I'm doing this
for my future. For our future.

1238
01:58:05,777 --> 01:58:08,894
You're doing this for some image,
for Freddie because he did it.

1239
01:58:09,057 --> 01:58:11,366
-Yeah? Maybe.
-Yeah? Well, he died doing it.

1240
01:58:11,657 --> 01:58:13,727
-He could have been a real actor.
-He was!

1241
01:58:13,897 --> 01:58:17,492
He was funny and charming
and he made people laugh. That's it.

1242
01:58:17,657 --> 01:58:20,967
-That's plenty!
-That's not enough! Not for you!

1243
01:58:21,137 --> 01:58:22,889
-Jesus Christ!
-You are good, Ralph.

1244
01:58:23,057 --> 01:58:25,446
-You're seriously really good.
-Jesus.

1245
01:58:25,617 --> 01:58:30,247
You're full of rage and pain and love.
Not just jokes. You're an original.

1246
01:58:30,417 --> 01:58:32,248
The original Ralph Garci.

1247
01:58:32,497 --> 01:58:36,012
-You don't have to be somebody else.
-You're bringing me down!

1248
01:58:36,177 --> 01:58:38,691
-You're bringing me fucking down!
-I'm sorry!

1249
01:58:38,857 --> 01:58:42,736
I gotta go make people laugh, and
you're talking about rage and pain.

1250
01:58:42,897 --> 01:58:45,331
-I said I'm sorry!
-It takes fucking wings.

1251
01:58:45,497 --> 01:58:48,648
Miss Seriously, let me tear flypaper, huh?

1252
01:58:49,137 --> 01:58:51,014
Give me a fucking break, honey!

1253
01:58:51,177 --> 01:58:54,692
Give me a fucking break.
Okay, pal? Thank you.

1254
01:58:57,577 --> 01:59:01,286
-What's happening to you?
-What's happening to me? Success.

1255
01:59:01,457 --> 01:59:05,336
Now, you either hang on or hang up.
All right?

1256
01:59:10,737 --> 01:59:14,366
It's a great pleasure to introduce
a young man who's funny and loud.

1257
01:59:14,537 --> 01:59:15,811
Especially during my act.

1258
01:59:15,977 --> 01:59:19,765
Please welcome the comedy stylings
of Ralph Garci, ladies and gentlemen.

1259
01:59:22,177 --> 01:59:27,205
That's right. My name is Ralph Garci,
and I'm a professional asshole.

1260
01:59:31,057 --> 01:59:36,051
That's right. I see we have a couple
of amateurs in the audience tonight.

1261
01:59:36,497 --> 01:59:38,055
Don't we?

1262
01:59:39,377 --> 01:59:42,016
I see. How about sign language?

1263
01:59:42,177 --> 01:59:45,613
We have a standing ovation
over there.

1264
01:59:45,977 --> 01:59:49,128
That's great. Hon, where you from?

1265
01:59:50,017 --> 01:59:54,215
Okey-dokey. That's my best friend.

1266
01:59:55,697 --> 01:59:57,494
Yeah, friends are important.

1267
01:59:58,897 --> 02:00:02,890
I live in the South Bronx, and up there,
you got the Harlems of--

1268
02:00:03,177 --> 02:00:06,886
Shit! I'm sorry.
Excuse me. Fuck it.

1269
02:00:07,337 --> 02:00:08,816
That was supposed to be. . . .

1270
02:00:09,297 --> 02:00:13,210
The north-- The countries north
of Harlem and west of Puerto Rico.

1271
02:00:13,617 --> 02:00:16,211
That's what it was supposed to be.
Yes, indeed it was.

1272
02:00:16,377 --> 02:00:18,368
Anyway, there's lots of things there:

1273
02:00:18,537 --> 02:00:22,246
Rats, cockroaches,
and, you know, little bugs.

1274
02:00:22,417 --> 02:00:25,932
You know what cockroaches are?
Little things that crawl in the night.

1275
02:00:27,857 --> 02:00:32,294
Listen, I don't mean to alarm you,
but if you don't laugh, you'll get cancer.

1276
02:00:34,377 --> 02:00:38,370
Sorry. That was probably in bad taste,
and I didn't really. . . .

1277
02:00:42,457 --> 02:00:46,530
Excuse me. Fuck it.
Thank you very much.

1278
02:01:06,897 --> 02:01:07,966
What do you want?

1279
02:01:08,657 --> 02:01:10,727
Pizza sounds good.
You wanna eat?

1280
02:01:11,457 --> 02:01:14,176
Could you give me a break, all right?

1281
02:01:14,617 --> 02:01:17,450
We could split a special,
with anchovies, maybe.

1282
02:01:17,737 --> 02:01:22,765
Fuck anchovies. I died out there,
you're talking about fucking pizzas?

1283
02:01:22,937 --> 02:01:28,295
-No, I'm talking about eating pizzas.
-Oh, that's very funny. You're a howl.

1284
02:01:28,457 --> 02:01:31,415
You should have been out there.
The audience hated me.

1285
02:01:31,577 --> 02:01:35,729
-You had a bad night. That happens.
-Not to me, it doesn't.

1286
02:01:35,897 --> 02:01:39,048
What do you want? lnsurance?
You're in the wrong business.

1287
02:01:39,217 --> 02:01:42,015
Performers aren't safe.
We're pie-in-the-face people.

1288
02:01:42,177 --> 02:01:45,374
Look, don't lecture me.
All right, Sir Laurence?

1289
02:01:45,537 --> 02:01:49,291
All anyone ever promised you was
seven classes a day and a hot lunch.

1290
02:01:49,777 --> 02:01:51,176
The rest is up to you.

1291
02:01:51,337 --> 02:01:55,694
Back in the Middle Ages, actors,
they didn't even want to bury us.

1292
02:01:56,657 --> 02:01:58,329
Well, they do now.

1293
02:01:59,057 --> 02:02:01,571
Not if you're good.

1294
02:02:03,257 --> 02:02:04,929
How do you know?

1295
02:02:05,857 --> 02:02:08,496
How do you know if you're good?

1296
02:02:08,657 --> 02:02:10,693
Maybe you never know.

1297
02:02:15,857 --> 02:02:19,167
You just hang in, I guess.

1298
02:02:23,377 --> 02:02:25,208
You know the weirdest thing. . .

1299
02:02:26,017 --> 02:02:27,769
. . .is Freddie.

1300
02:02:28,617 --> 02:02:32,656
When he made it, he realized
it was everything he hated.

1301
02:02:33,177 --> 02:02:35,168
Cadillac Eldorado.

1302
02:02:35,337 --> 02:02:37,328
Pocketful of Quaaludes.

1303
02:02:37,497 --> 02:02:38,896
Johnny Carson.

1304
02:02:39,057 --> 02:02:41,127
It was no special shit.

1305
02:02:41,417 --> 02:02:43,533
You're not Freddie, Ralph.

1306
02:02:43,697 --> 02:02:46,086
I know that. I know.

1307
02:02:47,377 --> 02:02:51,529
Know something else about Freddie?
Freddie didn't even want to be Freddie.

1308
02:02:51,697 --> 02:02:55,690
-No?
-No. He wanted to be Joe Namath.

1309
02:02:57,937 --> 02:02:59,131
You laughed.

1310
02:02:59,297 --> 02:03:01,857
-Guess I'm funny.
-Let's get out of here.

1311
02:03:13,897 --> 02:03:15,046
5'7"?

1312
02:03:21,697 --> 02:03:24,211
Okay, you're finished.
Stand over there.

1313
02:03:24,377 --> 02:03:26,891
Go on. Keep the line moving.
Come on.
